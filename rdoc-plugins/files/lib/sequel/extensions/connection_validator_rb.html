            <p>The connection_validator extension modifies a database’s connection pool to
            validate that connections checked out from the pool are still valid, before
            yielding them for use.  If it detects an invalid connection, it removes it
            from the pool and tries the next available connection, creating a new
            connection if no available connection is valid.  Example of use:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.extension(:connection_validator)</pre>
            
            <p>As checking connections for validity involves issuing a query, which is
            potentially an expensive operation, the validation checks are only run if
            the connection has been idle for longer than a certain threshold. By
            default, that threshold is 3600 seconds (1 hour), but it can be modified by
            the user, set to -1 to always validate connections on checkout:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.pool.connection_validation_timeout = -1</pre>
            
            <p>Note that if you set the timeout to validate connections on every checkout,
            you should probably manually control connection checkouts on a coarse
            basis, using Database#synchronize.  In a web application, the optimal place
            for that would be a rack middleware.  Validating connections on every
            checkout without setting up coarse connection checkouts will hurt
            performance, in some cases significantly.  Note that setting up coarse
            connection checkouts reduces the concurrency level acheivable.  For
            example, in a web application, using Database#synchronize in a rack
            middleware will limit the number of concurrent web requests to the number
            to connections in the database connection pool.</p>
            
            <p>Note that this extension only affects the default threaded and the sharded
            threaded connection pool.  The single threaded and sharded single threaded
            connection pools are not affected.  As the only reason to use the single
            threaded pools is for speed, and this extension makes the connection pool
            slower, there’s not much point in modifying this extension to work with the
            single threaded pools.  The threaded pools work fine even in single
            threaded code, so if you are currently using a single threaded pool and
            want to use this extension, switch to using a threaded pool.</p>
