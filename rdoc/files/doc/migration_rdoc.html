            <p>This guide is based on <a
            href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html</a></p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Overview">Overview</h2>
            
            <p>Migrations make it easy to alter your database’s schema in a systematic
            manner. They make it easier to coordinate with other developers and make
            sure that all developers are using the same database schema.</p>
            
            <p>Migrations are optional, you don’t have to use them.  You can always just
            create the necessary database structure manually using Sequel’s schema
            modification methods or another database tool.  However, if you are dealing
            with other developers, you’ll have to send them all of the changes you are
            making.  Even if you aren’t dealing with other developers, you generally
            have to make the schema changes in 3 places (development, testing, and
            production), and it’s probably easier to use the migrations system to apply
            the schema changes than it is to keep track of the changes manually and
            execute them manually at the appropriate time.</p>
            
            <p><a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> tracks which migrations you
            have already run, so to apply migrations you generally need to run Sequel's
            migrator with <code>bin/sequel -m</code>:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -m path/to/migrations postgres://host/database</pre>
            
            <p>Migrations in <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> use a very
            simple DSL via the <code>Sequel.migration</code> method, and inside the
            DSL, use the <code>Sequel::Database</code> schema modification methods such
            as <code>create_table</code> and <code>alter_table</code>. See the <a
            href="schema_modification_rdoc.html">schema modification guide</a> for
            details on the schema modification methods you can use.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-A+Basic+Migration">A Basic Migration</h2>
            
            <p>Here is a fairly basic <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>
            migration:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">migration</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">up</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">create_table</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;      <span class="ruby-identifier">primary_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>&#x000A;      <span class="ruby-constant">String</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">null=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">false</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">down</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">drop_table</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>)&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>This migration has an <code>up</code> block which adds an artist table with
            an integer primary key named id, and a varchar or text column (depending on
            the database) named <code>name</code> that doesn’t accept <code>NULL</code>
            values. Migrations should include both up and <code>down</code> blocks,
            with the <code>down</code> block reversing the change made by up.  However,
            if you never need to be able to migrate down (i.e. you are one of the
            people that doesn’t make mistakes), you can leave out the <code>down</code>
            block.  In this case, the <code>down</code> block just reverses the changes
            made by up, dropping the table.</p>
            
            <p>You can simplify the migration given above by using a reversible migration
            with a <code>change</code> block:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">migration</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">change</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">create_table</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;      <span class="ruby-identifier">primary_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>&#x000A;      <span class="ruby-constant">String</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">null=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">false</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>The <code>change</code> block acts exactly like an <code>up</code> block. 
            The only difference is that it will attempt to create a <code>down</code>
            block for you, assuming that it knows how to reverse the given migration. 
            The <code>change</code> block can usually correctly reverse the following
            methods:</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p><code>create_table</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_column</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_index</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>rename_column</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>rename_table</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>alter_table</code> (supporting the following methods in the
            <code>alter_table</code> block):</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p><code>add_column</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_constraint</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_foreign_key</code> (with a symbol, not an array)</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_primary_key</code> (with a symbol, not an array)</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_index</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_full_text_index</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>add_spatial_index</code></p>
            </li><li>
            <p><code>rename_column</code></p>
            </li></ul>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>If you use any other methods, you should create your own <code>down</code>
            block.</p>
            
            <p>In normal usage, when Sequel’s migrator runs, it runs the <code>up</code>
            blocks for all migrations that have not yet been applied.  However, you can
            use the <code>-M</code> switch to specify the version to which to migrate,
            and if it is lower than the current version, <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will run the <code>down</code>
            block on the appropriate migrations.</p>
            
            <p>You are not limited to creating tables inside a migration, you can alter
            existing tables as well as modify data.  Let’s say your artist database
            originally only included artists from Sacramento, CA, USA, but now you want
            to branch out and include artists in any city:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">migration</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">up</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">add_column</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">location</span>, <span class="ruby-constant">String</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">from</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>).<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">location=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">'Sacramento'</span>)&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">down</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">drop_column</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">location</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>This migration adds a <code>location</code> column to the
            <code>artists</code> table, and sets the <code>location</code> column to
            <code>'Sacramento'</code> for all existing artists.  It doesn’t use a
            default on the column, because future artists should not be assumed to come
            from Sacramento.  In the <code>down</code> block, it just drops the
            <code>location</code> column from the <code>artists</code> table, reversing
            the actions of the up block.</p>
            
            <p>Note that when updating the <code>artists</code> table in the update, a
            plain dataset is used, <code>from(:artists)</code>. This looks a little
            weird, but you need to be aware that inside an up or <code>down</code>
            block in a migration, self always refers to the
            <code>Sequel::Database</code> object that the migration is being applied
            to. Since <code>Database#from</code> creates datasets, using
            <code>from(:artists)</code> inside the <code>up</code> block creates a
            dataset on the database representing all columns in the
            <code>artists</code> table, and updates it to set the <code>location</code>
            column to <code>'Sacramento'</code>.  You should avoid referencing the
            <code>Sequel::Database</code> object directly in your migration, and always
            use self to reference it, otherwise you may run into problems.</p>
            
            <p>It is possible to use model classes inside migrations, as long as they are
            loaded into the ruby interpreter, but it’s a bad habit as changes to your
            model classes can then break old migrations, and this breakage is often not
            caught until much later, such as when a new developer joins the team and
            wants to run all migrations to create their development database.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-The+migration+extension">The <code>migration</code> extension</h2>
            
            <p>The migration code is not technically part of the core of <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>.  It’s not loaded by default as
            it is only useful in specific cases.  It is one of the extensions that ship
            with <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, which receive the same
            level of support as Sequel’s core.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to play with Sequel’s migration tools without using the
            <code>bin/sequel</code> tool, you need to load the migration extension
            manually:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.extension :migration</pre>
            
            <h2 id="label-Schema+methods">Schema methods</h2>
            
            <p>Migrations themselves do not contain any schema modification methods, but
            they make it easy to call any of the <code>Sequel::Database</code>
            modification methods, of which there are many.  The main ones are
            <code>create_table</code> and <code>alter_table</code>, but <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> also comes with numerous other
            schema modification methods, most of which are shortcuts for
            <code>alter_table</code> (all of these methods are described in more detail
            in the <a href="schema_modification_rdoc.html">schema modification
            guide</a></p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>add_column</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>add_index</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>create_view</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>drop_column</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>drop_index</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>drop_table</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>drop_view</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>rename_table</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>rename_column</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>set_column_default</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>set_column_type</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>These methods handle the vast majority of cross database schema
            modification SQL.  If you need to drop down to SQL to execute some database
            specific code, you can use the <code>run</code> method:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  up{run 'CREATE TRIGGER ...'}&#x000A;  down{run 'DROP TRIGGER ...'}&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <p>In this case, we are using { and } instead of do and end to define the
            blocks. Just as before, the <code>run</code> methods inside the blocks are
            called on the <code>Database</code> object, which just executes the code on
            the underlying database.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Errors+when+running+migrations">Errors when running migrations</h2>
            
            <p><a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> attempts to run migrations
            inside of a transaction if the database supports transactional DDL
            statements.  On the databases that don't support transactional DDL
            statements, if there is an error while running a migration, it will not
            rollback the previous schema changes made by the migration.  In that case,
            you will need to update the database by hand.</p>
            
            <p>It’s recommended to always run migrations on a test database and ensure
            they work before running them on any production database.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Transactions">Transactions</h2>
            
            <p>You can manually specify to use transactions on a per migration basis.  For
            example, if you want to force transaction use for a particular migration,
            call the transaction method in the <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html#method-c-migration">Sequel.migration</a>
            block:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  transaction&#x000A;  change do&#x000A;    # ...&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <p>Likewise, you can disable transaction use via no_transaction:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  no_transaction&#x000A;  change do&#x000A;    # ...&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <p>This is necessary in some cases, such as when attempting to use CREATE
            INDEX CONCURRENTLY on PostgreSQL (which supports transactional schema, but
            not that statement inside a transaction).</p>
            
            <p>You can also override the transactions setting at the migrator level,
            either by forcing transactions even if no_transaction is set, or by
            disabling transactions all together:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># Force transaction use</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Migrator</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">run</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'/path/to/migrations/dir'</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">use_transactions=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>)&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># Disable use of transactions</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Migrator</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">run</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'/path/to/migrations/dir'</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">use_transactions=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">false</span>)</pre>
            
            <h2 id="label-Migration+files">Migration files</h2>
            
            <p>While you can create migration objects yourself and apply them manually,
            most of the benefit to using migrations come from using Sequel’s
            <code>Migrator</code>, which is what the <code>bin/sequel -m</code> switch
            does.  Sequel’s <code>Migrator</code> expects that each migration will be
            in a separate file in a specific directory.  The <code>-m</code> switch
            requires an argument be specified that is the path to the directory
            containing the migration files. For example:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -m db/migrations postgres://localhost/sequel_test</pre>
            
            <p>will look in the <code>db/migrations</code> folder relative to the current
            directory, and run unapplied migrations on the PostgreSQL database
            sequel_test running on localhost.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Two+separate+migrators">Two separate migrators</h2>
            
            <p><a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> actually ships with two
            separate migrators.  One is the <code>IntegerMigrator</code>, the other is

            <h3 id="label-Filenames">Filenames</h3>
            
            <p>In order for migration files to work with the <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, they must be specified as
            follows:</p>
            
            <pre>version_name.rb</pre>
            
            <p>where <code>version</code> is an integer and <code>name</code> is a string
            which should be a very brief description of what the migration does.  Each
            migration class should contain 1 and only 1 call to
            <code>Sequel.migration</code>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="label-IntegerMigrator+Filenames"><code>IntegerMigrator</code> Filenames</h3>
            
            <p>These are valid migration names for the <code>IntegerMigrator</code>:</p>
            
            <pre>1_create_artists.rb&#x000A;2_add_artist_location.rb</pre>
            
            <p>The only problem with this naming format is that if you have more than 9
            migrations, the 10th one will look a bit odd:</p>
            
            <pre>1_create_artists.rb&#x000A;2_add_artist_location.rb&#x000A;...&#x000A;9_do_something.rb&#x000A;10_do_something_else.rb</pre>
            
            <p>For this reasons, it’s often best to start with 001 instead of 1, as that
            means you don’t need to worry about that issue until the 1000th migration:</p>
            
            <pre>001_create_artists.rb&#x000A;002_add_artist_location.rb&#x000A;...&#x000A;009_do_something.rb&#x000A;010_do_something_else.rb</pre>
            
            <p>Migrations start at 1, not 0.  The migration version number 0 is important
            though, as it is used to mean that all migrations should be unapplied (i.e.
            all <code>down</code> blocks run).  In <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, you can do that with:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -m db/migrations -M 0 postgres://localhost/sequel_test</pre>
            
            <h3 id="label-TimestampMigrator+Filenames"><code>TimestampMigrator</code> Filenames</h3>
            
            <p>With the <code>TimestampMigrator</code>, the version integer should
            represent a timestamp, though this isn’t strictly required.</p>
            
            <p>For example, for <code>5/10/2010 12:00:00pm</code>, you could use any of
            the following formats:</p>
            
            <pre># Date&#x000A;20100510_create_artists.rb&#x000A;# Date and Time&#x000A;20100510120000_create_artists.rb&#x000A;&#x000A;# Unix Epoch Time Integer&#x000A;1273518000_create_artists.rb</pre>
            
            <p>The important thing is that all migration files should be in the same
            format, otherwise when you update, it’ll be difficult to make sure
            migrations are applied in the correct order, as well as be difficult to
            unapply some the affected migrations correctly.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>TimestampMigrator</code> will be used if any filename in the
            migrations directory has a version greater than 20000101.  Otherwise, the
            <code>IntegerMigrator</code> will be used.</p>
            
            <p>You can force the use of the <code>TimestampMigrator</code> in the API by
            calling TimestampMigrator.apply instead of Migrator.apply.</p>
            
            <h3 id="label-How+to+choose">How to choose</h3>
            
            <p>Basically, unless you need the features provided by the
            <code>TimestampMigrator</code>, stick with the
            <code>IntegerMigrator</code>, as it is simpler and makes it easier to
            detect possible errors.</p>
            
            <p>For a single developer, the <code>TimestampMigrator</code> has no real
            benefits, so I would always recommend the <code>IntegerMigrator</code>. 
            When dealing with multiple developers, it depends on the size of the
            development team, the team’s communication level, and the level of overlap
            between developers.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s say Alice works on a new feature that requires a migration at the
            same time Bob works on a separate feature that requires an unrelated
            migration.  If both developers are committing to their own private
            respositories, when it comes time to merge, the
            <code>TimestampMigrator</code> will not require any manually changes. 
            That’s because Alice will have a migration such as
            <code>20100512_do_this.rb</code> and Bob will have one such as
            <code>20100512_do_that.rb</code>.</p>
            
            <p>If the <code>IntegerMigrator</code> was used, Alice would have
            <code>34_do_this.rb</code> and Bob would have <code>34_do_that.rb</code>. 
            When the <code>IntegerMigrator</code> was used, it would raise an exception
            due to the duplicate migration version.  The only way to fix it would be to
            renumber one of the two migrations, and have the affected developer
            manually modify their database.</p>
            
            <p>So for unrelated migrations, the <code>TimestampMigrator</code> works fine.
            However, let’s say that the migrations are related, in such a way that if
            Bob’s is run first, Alice’s will fail.  In this case, the
            <code>TimestampMigrator</code> would not raise an error when Bob merges
            Alice’s changes, since Bob ran his migration first.  However, it would
            raise an error when Alice runs Bob’s migration, and could leave the
            database in an inconsistent state if the database doesn’t support
            transactional schema changes.</p>
            
            <p>With the <code>TimestampMigrator</code>, you are trading reliability for
            convenience.  That’s possibly a valid trade, especially if simultaneous
            related schema changes by separate developers are unlikely, but you should
            give it some thought before using it.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Ignoring+missing+migrations">Ignoring missing migrations</h2>
            
            <p>In some cases, you may want to allow a migration in the database that does
            not exist in the filesystem (deploying to an older version of code without
            running a down migration when deploy auto-migrates, for example). If
            required, you can pass &lt;tt&gt;:allow_missing_migration_files =&gt;
            true&lt;tt&gt; as an option. This will stop errors from being raised if
            there are migrations in the database that do not exist in the filesystem.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Modifying+existing+migrations">Modifying existing migrations</h2>
            
            <p>Just don’t do it.</p>
            
            <p>In general, you should not modify any migration that has been run on the
            database and been committed to the source control repository, unless the
            migration contains an error that causes data loss.  As long as it is
            possible to undo the migration without losing data, you should just add
            another migration that undoes the actions of the previous bad migration,
            and maybe does the correct action afterward.</p>
            
            <p>The main problem with modifying existing migrations is that you will have
            to manually modify any databases that ran the migration before it was
            modified.  If you are a single developer, that may be an option, but
            certainly if you have multiple developers, it’s a lot more work.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Creating+a+migration">Creating a migration</h2>
            
            <p><a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> doesn't come with generators
            that create migrations for you.  However, creating a migration is as simple
            as creating a file with the appropriate filename in your migrations
            directory that contains a <code>Sequel.migration</code> call.  The minimal
            do-nothing migration is:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration{}</pre>
            
            <p>However, the migrations you write should contain an <code>up</code> block
            that does something, and a <code>down</code> block that reverses the
            changes made by the <code>up</code> block:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  up{...}&#x000A;  down{...}&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <p>or they should use the reversible migrations feature with a
            <code>change</code> block:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  change{...}&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <h2 id="label-What+to+put+in+your+migration%27s+down+block">What to put in your migration’s <code>down</code> block</h2>
            
            <p>It’s usually easy to determine what you should put in your migration’s
            <code>up</code> block, as it’s whatever change you want to make to the
            database.  The <code>down</code> block is less obvious.  In general, it
            should reverse the changes made by the <code>up</code> block, which means
            it should execute the opposite of what the <code>up</code> block does in
            the reverse order in which the <code>up</code> block does it.  Here’s an
            example where you are switching from having a single artist per album to
            multiple artists per album:</p>

            <p>Note that the operations performed in the <code>down</code> block are

            <code>up</code> block.  Also note how it isn’t always possible to reverse
            exactly what was done in the <code>up</code> block.  You should try to do
            so as much as possible, but if you can’t, you may want to have your
            <code>down</code> block raise a <code>Sequel::Error</code> exception saying
            why the migration cannot be reverted.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Running+migrations">Running migrations</h2>
            
            <p>You can run migrations using the <code>sequel</code> command line program
            that comes with <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>.  If you use
            the <code>-m</code> switch, <code>sequel</code> will run the migrator
            instead of giving you an IRB session.  The <code>-m</code> switch requires
            an argument that should be a path to a directory of migration files:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -m relative/path/to/migrations postgres://host/database&#x000A;sequel -m /absolute/path/to/migrations postgres://host/database</pre>
            
            <p>If you do not provide a <code>-M</code> switch, <code>sequel</code> will
            migrate to the latest version in the directory.  If you provide a
            <code>-M</code> switch, it should specify an integer version to which to
            migrate.</p>
            
            <pre># Migrate all the way down&#x000A;sequel -m db/migrations -M 0 postgres://host/database&#x000A;# Migrate to version 10 (IntegerMigrator style migrations)&#x000A;sequel -m db/migrations -M 10 postgres://host/database&#x000A;&#x000A;# Migrate to version 20100510 (TimestampMigrator migrations using YYYYMMDD)&#x000A;sequel -m db/migrations -M 20100510 postgres://host/database</pre>
            
            <p>Whether or not migrations use the <code>up</code> or <code>down</code>
            block depends on the version to which you are migrating.  If you don’t
            provide a <code>-M</code> switch, all unapplied migrations will be migrated
            up.  If you provide a <code>-M</code>, it will depend on which migrations
            that have been applied.  Applied migrations greater than that version will
            be migrated down, while unapplied migrations less than or equal to that
            version will be migrated up.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Verbose+migrations">Verbose migrations</h2>
            
            <p>By default, <code>sequel -m</code> operates as a well behaved command line
            utility should, printing out nothing if there is no error.  If you want to
            see the SQL being executed during a migration, as well as the amount of
            time that each migration takes, you can use the <code>-E</code> option to
            <code>sequel</code> to set up a <code>Database</code> logger that logs to
            <code>STDOUT</code>.  You can also log that same output to a file using the
            <code>-l</code> option with a log file name.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Using+models+in+your+migrations">Using models in your migrations</h2>
            
            <p>Just don’t do it.</p>
            
            <p>It can be tempting to use models in your migrations, especially since it’s
            easy to load them at the same time using the <code>-L</code> option to
            <code>sequel</code>.  However, this ties your migrations to your models,
            and makes it so that changes in your models can break old migrations.</p>
            
            <p>With <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, it should be easy to
            use plain datasets to accomplish pretty much anything you would want to
            accomplish in a migration.  Even if you have to copy some code from a model
            method into a migration itself, it’s better than having your migration use
            models and call model methods.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Dumping+the+current+schema+as+a+migration">Dumping the current schema as a migration</h2>
            
            <p><a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> comes with a
            <code>schema_dumper</code> extension that dumps the current schema of the
            database as a migration to <code>STDOUT</code> (which you can redirect to a
            file using &gt;).  This is exposed in the <code>sequel</code> command line
            tool with the <code>-d</code> and <code>-D</code> switches. 
            <code>-d</code> dumps the schema in database independent format, while
            <code>-D</code> dumps the schema using a non-portable format, useful if you
            are using nonportable columns such as <code>inet</code> in your database.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s say you have an existing database and want to create a migration that
            would recreate the database’s schema:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -d postgres://host/database &gt; db/migrations/001_start.rb</pre>
            
            <p>or using a nonportable format:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -D postgres://host/database &gt; db/migrations/001_start.rb</pre>
            
            <p>The main difference between the two is that <code>-d</code> will use the
            type methods with the database independent ruby class types, while
            <code>-D</code> will use the <code>column</code> method with string types.</p>
            
            <p>Note that <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> cannot dump
            constraints other than primary key and possibly foreign key constraints. 
            If you are using database features such as constraints or triggers, you
            should use your database’s dump and restore programs instead of Sequel’s
            schema dumper.</p>
            
            <p>You can take the migration created by the schema dumper to another computer
            with an empty database, and attempt to recreate the schema using:</p>
            
            <pre>sequel -m db/migrations postgres://host/database</pre>
            
            <h2 id="label-Checking+for+Current+Migrations">Checking for Current Migrations</h2>
            
            <p>In your application code, you may want to check that you are up to date in
            regards to migrations (i.e. you don’t have any unapplied migrations).  <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> offers two separate methods to
            do that.  The first is <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel/Migrator.html#method-c-check_current">Sequel::Migrator.check_current</a>.
            This method raises an exception if there are outstanding migrations that
            need to be run.  The second is <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel/Migrator.html#method-c-is_current-3F">Sequel::Migrator.is_current?</a>,
            which returns true if there are no outstanding migrations, and false if
            there are outstanding migrations.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to ensure that your application code is up to date, you may
            want to add the following code after connecting to your database:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.extension :migration&#x000A;Sequel::Migrator.check_current(DB, '/path/to/migrations')</pre>
            
            <p>This will cause your application to raise an error when you start it if you
            have any outstanding migrations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Old-style+migration+classes">Old-style migration classes</h2>
            
            <p>Before the <code>Sequel.migration</code> DSL was introduced, <a
            href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> used classes for Migrations:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Class</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Migration</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">up</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">down</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>or:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">DoSomething</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Migration</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">up</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">down</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>This usage is discouraged in new code, but will continue to be supported
            indefinitely. It is not recommended to convert old-style migration classes
            to the <code>Sequel.migration</code> DSL, but it is recommended to use the
            <code>Sequel.migration</code> DSL for all new migrations.</p>
