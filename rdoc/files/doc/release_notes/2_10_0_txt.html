            <p>New Supported Adapters and Databases</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>A DataObjects adapter was added that supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
            SQLite.  DataObjects is the underlying database library used by DataMapper,
            and has potential performance advantages by doing all typecasting in C.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A Firebird Adapter was added, it requires the modified Ruby Fb adapter
            found at <a target="_top" href="http://github.com/wishdev/fb.">github.com/wishdev/fb.</a></p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An H2 JDBC subadapter was added, based on the code used in JotBot. H2 is an
            embeddable Java database, and may be preferable to using SQLite on JDBC
            because SQLite requires native code.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>New Core Features</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has database
            independent migrations.  Before, column types in migrations were not
            translated per database, so it was difficult to set up a migration that
            worked on multiple databases. <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now accepts ruby classes as
            database types, in addition to symbols and strings.  If a ruby class is
            used, it is translated to the most appropriate database type.  Here is an
            example using all supported classes (with Sequel's default database type):</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create_table</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">cats</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">primary_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">type=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-constant">Integer</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># integer</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">String</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>                       <span class="ruby-comment"># varchar(255)</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">column</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span>, <span class="ruby-constant">File</span>                 <span class="ruby-comment"># blob</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">Fixnum</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">c</span>                       <span class="ruby-comment"># integer</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">foreign_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">d</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">other_table</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">type=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-constant">Bignum</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># bigint</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">Float</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">e</span>                        <span class="ruby-comment"># double precision</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">BigDecimal</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">f</span>                   <span class="ruby-comment"># numeric</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">Date</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">g</span>                         <span class="ruby-comment"># date</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">DateTime</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">h</span>                     <span class="ruby-comment"># timestamp</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">Time</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">i</span>                         <span class="ruby-comment"># timestamp</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">Numeric</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">j</span>                      <span class="ruby-comment"># numeric</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">TrueClass</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">k</span>                    <span class="ruby-comment"># boolean</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">FalseClass</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">l</span>                   <span class="ruby-comment"># boolean</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>Type translations were tested on the PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and H2
            databases.  The default translations should work OK for most databases, but
            there will probably be a type or two that doesn’t work.  Please send in a
            patch if <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> uses a column
            type that doesn’t work on your database.</p>
            
            <p>Note that existing migrations still work fine, in most cases.  If you were
            using strings or symbols for types before, they should still work.  See the
            Backwards Compatibility section below for details.</p>
            
            <p>Also note that this doesn’t relate solely to migrations, as any database
            schema modification method that accepts types will accept one of the above
            classes.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A ton of internal work was done to better support databases that fold
            unqouted identifiers to uppercase (which is the SQL standard). <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now allows you to set a
            method to call on identifiers going both into and out of the database.  The
            default is to downcase identifiers coming out, and upcase identifiers going
            in, though this is overridden by the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite adapters
            to not do anything (since they fold to lowercase by default).</p>
            
            <p>The settings are called identifier_input_method and
            identifier_output_method, and like most <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> settings, they can be set
            globally, per database, or per dataset:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># Global (use uppercase in ruby and lowercase in the database)</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_input_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">downcase</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_output_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">upcase</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># Per Database (use camelized names in the database, and</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment">#               underscored names in ruby)</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_input_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">camelize</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_output_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">underscore</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># Per Dataset (obfuscate your database columns!)</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">String</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">rot_13</span>; <span class="ruby-identifier">tr</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'A-Za-z'</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">table</span>]&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_input_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">rot_13</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">identifier_output_method</span> = :<span class="ruby-identifier">rot_13</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Schema parsing support was added to the JDBC adapter, using the JDBC
            metadata methods.  This means that models that use the JDBC adapter will
            typecast data in their column setters and automatically select the correct
            primary key column(s).  This is currently the only adapter that supports
            schema parsing when using an MSSQL or Oracle database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#create_table now takes options, which you can use to specify a
            MySQL engine, charset, and/or collation.  You can also set a default
            engine, charset, and collation for MySQL to use:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel::MySQL.default_engine = 'InnoDB'&#x000A;Sequel::MySQL.default_charset = 'utf8'&#x000A;Sequel::MySQL.default_collate = 'utf8'</pre>
            
            <p>The defaults will be used if the options are not provided.  If a default
            engine is set, you can specify :engine=&gt;nil to not use it (same goes for
            charset and collate).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/DatabaseConnectionError.html">Sequel::DatabaseConnectionError</a>
            exception class was added.  It is raised by the connection pool if there is
            an error attempting to instantiate a database connection.  Also, if the
            adapter returns nil instead of raising an error for faulty connection
            parameters, DatabaseConnectionError will be raised immediately, instead of
            the connection pool busy waiting until if gives up with a PoolTimeoutError.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#tables is now supported on the JDBC adapter, returning an <a
            href="../../../classes/Array.html">Array</a> of table name symbols.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now converts the
            following Java types returned by the JDBC adapter into ruby types:
            Java::JavaSQL::Timestamp, Java::JavaSQL::Time, Java::JavaSQL::Date,
            Java::JavaMath::BigDecimal, and Java::JavaIo::BufferedReader.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When using the PostgreSQL adapter with the postgres-pr driver, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will use a custom string
            escaping routine unless force_standard_strings = false.  This means that
            using Sequel’s defaults, postgres-pr will correctly escape strings now.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The SQLite adapter now returns float, real, and double precision columns as
            Floats.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The SQLite adapter logs beginning, committing, and rolling back
            transactions.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has an internal
            version (before, the only way to tell the version was to look at the gem
            being used).  It is accessible at <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html#method-c-version">Sequel.version</a>.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>New Model Features</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>A new validates_not_string validation was added for <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> Models. It is intended to be
            used with the raise_on_typecast_failure = false setting.  In this case, for
            a non-string database column, if there is a string value when the record is
            going to be saved, it is due to the fact that <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> was not able to typecast the
            given data correctly (so it is almost certainly not valid). This should
            make <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> easier to use with
            web applications.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An :allow_missing validation option was added to all standard validations. 
            This option skips the validation if the attribute is not in the object’s
            values.  It is different from :allow_nil, which will skip the value if it
            is present but nil in the values. The intended use case for this option is
            when the database provides a good default.  If the attribute is not present
            in values, the database will use its default.  If the attribute is present
            in the values but equals nil, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will attempt to insert it
            into the database as a NULL value, instead of using the database’s default.
            If you don’t want <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> to
            insert a NULL value in the database, but you want the database to provide
            the default, this is the option to use.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>validates_each now accepts :allow_nil and :allow_blank options, so it is
            easier to create custom validations with the same options as the standard
            validations.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Before_* hooks now run in the reverse order that they were added. The
            purpose of hooks is to wrap existing functionality, and making later
            before_* hooks run before previous before_* hooks is the correct behavior.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now add you own hook types, via Model.add_hook_type.  This is
            intended for plugin use.  All of the standard hooks are now implemented
            using this method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The value of new? in a after_save hook now reflects the previous state of
            the model (so true for a create and false for an update), instead of always
            being false.  This makes it easier to have a complex after_save hook that
            still needs to differentiate between a newly created record and an updated
            record, without having to add separate after_create and after_update hooks.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The value of changed_columns in an after_update hook now reflects the value
            before the update occurred, instead of usually being empty.  Previously, to
            have this functionality, you generally had to save the value to an instance
            variable in a before_update hook so you could reference it in the
            after_update hook.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Other Improvements</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now longer overwrites the
            following <a href="../../../classes/Symbol.html">Symbol</a> instance
            methods when running on ruby 1.9: [], &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=.  One of
            Sequel's principals is that it does not override methods defined by ruby,
            and now that ruby 1.9 defines the above methods on <a
            href="../../../classes/Symbol.html">Symbol</a>, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> shouldn't be overwriting
            them.</p>
            
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> already provides a way to
            work around this issue when another library adds the same methods to <a
            href="../../../classes/Symbol.html">Symbol</a> that <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> does. For example, you need
            to change the following:</p>
            
            <pre>dataset.filter(:number &gt; 1)&#x000A;dataset.filter(:number &gt;= 2)&#x000A;dataset.filter(:name &lt; 'M')&#x000A;dataset.filter(:name &lt;= 'I')&#x000A;dataset.filter(:is_bool[:x])</pre>

            <p>The argument provided to the block is a <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQL/VirtualRow.html">Sequel::SQL::VirtualRow</a>.
            This class uses method_missing so that any methods called on it return
            Sequel::SQL::Identifiers (if no arguments are provided) or <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQL/Function.html">Sequel::SQL::Function</a>
            (if arguments are provided).</p>
            
            <p>If you were using one of the above symbol methods outside of a filter, you
            can to call sql_string, sql_number, or sql_function on the symbol.  So the
            following would also work:</p>
            
            <pre>dataset.filter(:number.sql_number &gt; 1)&#x000A;dataset.filter(:number.sql_number &gt;= 2)&#x000A;dataset.filter(:name.sql_string &lt; 'M')&#x000A;dataset.filter(:name.sql_number &lt;= 'I')&#x000A;dataset.filter(:is_bool.sql_function(:x))</pre>
            
            <p>Using the block argument makes for a nicer API, though, so I recommend
            using it when possible.</p>
            
            <p>Note that if you are running ruby 1.8 or jruby without the –1.9 flag, you
            don’t need to worry.  If you are running ruby 1.9 or jruby –1.9, or you
            plan to at some point in the future, you should inspect your code for
            existing uses of these methods. Here are a couple command lines that should
            find most uses:</p>
            
            <pre># Find :symbol[]&#x000A;egrep -nr ':['\''&quot;]?[a-zA-Z_0-9]*['\''&quot;]?\[' *&#x000A;# Find :symbol (&lt;|&gt;|&lt;=|&gt;=)&#x000A;egrep -nr '[^:]:['\''&quot;]?[a-zA-Z_0-9]*['\''&quot;]? *[&lt;&gt;]=?' *</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#quote_identifiers now affects future schema modifications when
            using the database.  Previous, it only affected future schema modifications
            if a schema modification method had not yet been called.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Literalization of Times and DateTimes is now correct when using the MySQL
            JDBC subadapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Literalization of Blobs is now correct when using the PostgreSQL JDBC
            subadapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Index and table names are quoted when creating indices in the PostgreSQL
            adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#delete was changed in the SQLite adapter to add a where clause that
            is always true, instead of doing an explicit count first and the deleting. 
            This is simpler, though it could potentially have performance implications.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The sequel command line tool now supports symbol keys and unnested hashes
            in YAML files, so it should work with Merb’s database.yml. It also includes
            the error class in the case of an error.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The integration type tests were greatly expanded.  Generally, running the
            integration tests is a good way to determine how well your database is
            supported.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#quote_identifier now returns LiteralStrings as-is, instead of
            treating them as regular strings.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> no longer modifies the
            MySQL::Result class when using the MySQL adapter.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Backwards Compatibilty</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>If you were previously using a database that returned uppercase
            identifiers, it will probably return lowercase identifiers by default now. 
            To get back the old behavior:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.identifier_output_method = nil</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>The module hierarchy under <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQL.html">Sequel::SQL</a> has changed.  Now,
            modules do not include other modules, and the following modules were
            removed since they would have been empty after removing the modules they
            included: Sequel::SQL::SpecificExpressionMethods and
            Sequel::SQL::GenericExpressionMethods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> no longer assumes the
            public schema by default when connecting to PostgreSQL.  You can still set
            the default schema to use (even to public).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The ability to load schema information for all tables at once was removed
            from the PostgreSQL adapter.  While it worked, it had some issues, and it
            was difficult to keep it working when some new features were used.  This
            ability wasn’t exposed to the user, and was purely an optimization.  If you
            have any code like:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.schema</pre>
            
            <p>by itself after the Database object was instantiated, you should remove it.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Database#primary_key API changed in the PostgreSQL shared adapter, it
            now accepts an options hash with :server and :conn keys instead of a server
            symbol.  Also, quite a few private Database instance methods changed, as
            well as some constants in the AdapterMethods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>It is possible that some migrations will break, though it is unlikely.  If
            you were using any of the classes mentioned above as a method inside a
            migration, it might be broken.  However, since <a
            href="../../../classes/String.html">String</a>, Float, and Integer wouldn’t
            have worked as methods before, it is unlikely that anyone used this.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The meaning of #<a href="../../../classes/String.html">String</a>,
            #Integer, and #Float inside Sequel::SQL::Generator (i.e. inside a
            Database#create_table block) has changed.  Before, these used to call
            private Kernel methods, now, they set up columns with the appropriate
            database type.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Database#lowercase method in the DBI adapter was removed, as its use
            case is now met by the identifier_output_method support.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#uri is now aliased explicitly via a real method, to allow for
            easier subclassing.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can no longer pass nil as the second argument to Database#create_table.</p>
