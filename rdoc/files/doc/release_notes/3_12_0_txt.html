            <h1 id="label-Migration+Changes">Migration Changes</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>A TimestampMigrator has been added to <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, and is automatically used
            if any migration has a version greater than</p>
            <ol><li>
            <p>This migrator operates similarly to the default</p>
            </li></ol>
            
            <p>ActiveRecord migrator, in that it allows missing migrations. It differs
            from the ActiveRecord migrator in that it supports migrations with the same
            timestamp/version as well as a wide variety of timestamp formats (though
            the ActiveRecord default of YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is recommended and should be
            used in portable code).</p>
            
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> still defaults to the old
            migrator, but you can use the new one without making changes to your old
            migrations.  Just make sure your new migration starts with a version
            greater than 20000100, and <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will automatically convert
            the previous schema table to the new format.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A new migration DSL was added:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.migration do&#x000A;  up do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;  down do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            
            <p>The old style of using a <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Migration.html">Sequel::Migration</a>
            subclass is still supported, but it is recommended that new code use the
            new DSL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The default migrator also had significant issues fixed.  First, it now
            saves the migration version after each migration, instead of after all
            migrations, which means <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>
            won’t attempt to apply already applied migrations if there was previously
            an error when applying multiple migrations at once on a database that
            didn’t support transactional schema modification.</p>
            
            <p>Second, duplicate migration versions in the default migrator now raise an
            exception, as do missing migration versions.  Neither should happen when
            using the default migrator, which requires consecutive integer versions,
            similar to the old ActiveRecord migrator.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Execution times for migrations are now logged to the database’s loggers.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-New+Plugins">New Plugins</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>A sharding plugin has been added that allows model objects to work well
            with sharded databases.  When using it, model objects know which shard they
            were retrieved from, so when you save the object, it is saved back to that
            shard.  The sharding plugin also works with associations, so associated
            records are retrieved from the same shard the main object was retreived
            from.  The sharding plugin also works with both methods of eager loading,
            and provides methods that you can use to create objects on specific shards.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An update_primary_key plugin has been added that allows <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> to work correctly if you
            modify the primary key of a model object. This should not be necessary if
            you are using surrogate keys, but if your database uses natural primary
            keys which can change, this should be helpful.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An association_pks plugin has been added that adds association_pks and
            association_pks= methods to model objects for both one_to_many and
            many_to_many associations.  The association_pks method returns an array of
            primary key values for the associated objects, and the association_pks=
            method modifies the database to ensure that the object is only associated
            to the objects specified by the array of primary keys provided to it.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A string_stripper plugin has been added that strips all strings that are
            assigned to attribute values.  This is useful for web applications where
            you want to easily remove leading and trailing whitespace in form entries
            before storing them in the database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A skip_create_refresh plugin has been added that skips the refresh of after
            you save a new model object.  On most databases, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> refreshes the model object
            after inserting it in order to get values for all of the columns.  For
            performance reasons, you can use this plugin to skip the refresh if it
            isn’t necessary for you.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+New+Features">Other New Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Sequel::Model#set_fields and update_fields were added.  These methods have
            a similar API to set_only and update_only, but they operate differently.
            While set_only and update_only operate over the hash, these methods operate
            over the array of fields, so they don’t raise errors if the hash contains
            fields not in the array:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">params</span> = {:<span class="ruby-identifier">a=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">1</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">b=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">2</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">c=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">3</span>}&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">album</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Album</span>[<span class="ruby-value">1</span>]&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># raises Error because :a is not in the fields</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">album</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">set_only</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>, [:<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">c</span>])&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># Just sets the value of album.b and album.c</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">album</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">set_fields</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>, [:<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">c</span>])</pre>
            
            <p>Other than handling entries in the hash that aren’t in the array,
            set_fields and update_fields also handle entries not in the hash
            differently:</p>
            
            <pre># Doesn't modify the object, since the hash is empty&#x000A;album.set_only({}, [:b, :c])&#x000A;# Sets album.b and album.c to nil, since they aren't in the hash&#x000A;album.set_fields({}, [:b, :c])</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>The :eager_loader association option has a new API, though the previous API
            still works.  Instead of accepting three arguments, it can now accept a
            single hash argument, which will use the :key_hash, :rows, and :association
            keys for the previous three arguments.  The hash will also contain a :self
            key whose value is the dataset doing the eager load, which was not possible
            to determine using the old API.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQL/Expression.html#method-i-hash">Sequel::SQL::Expression#hash</a>
            has been added so that the objects are now safe to use as hash keys.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A Dataset#order_prepend method has been added allowing you to prepend to an
            existing order.  This is useful if want to modify a dataset’s order such
            that it first orders by the columns you provide, but for any rows where the
            columns you provide are equal, uses the existing order to further order the
            dataset:</p>
            
            <pre>ds.order(:albums__name).order_prepend(:artists__name)&#x000A;# ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>When creating foreign key columns, you can now use a :deferrable option to
            set up a foreign key constraint that is not checked until the end of the
            transaction:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create_table</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">albums</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">primary_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-constant">String</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">foreign_key</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">artist_id</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">artists</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">deferrable=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>many_to_many associations now support a :join_table_block option that is
            used by the add/remove/remove_all methods.  It can modify the dataset to
            ensure that certain columns are included when inserting or to add a filter
            so that only certain records are deleted.  It’s useful if you have a
            many_to_many association that is filtered to only a subset of the matching
            rows in the join table.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The single_table_inheritance plugin now supports :model_map and :key_map
            options to set up a custom mapping of column values to model classes.  For
            simple situations such as when you are mapping integer values to certain
            classes, a :model_map hash is sufficient:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Employee</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">single_table_inheritance</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">type_id</span>,&#x000A; :<span class="ruby-identifier">model_map=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-value">1</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-constant">Staff</span>, <span class="ruby-value">2</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-constant">Manager</span>}</pre>
            
            <p>Here the :model_map keys are type_id column values, and the :model_map
            values are symbols or strings specifying class names.</p>
            
            <p>For more complex conditions, you can use a pair of procs:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Employee</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">single_table_inheritance</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">type_name</span>,&#x000A; :<span class="ruby-identifier">model_map=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-identifier">proc</span>{<span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">v</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">v</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">reverse</span>},&#x000A; :<span class="ruby-identifier">key_map=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-identifier">proc</span>{<span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">klass</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">klass</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">reverse</span>}</pre>
            
            <p>Here the type_name column is a string column holding the reverse of the
            class’s name.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The single_table_inheritance plugin now correctly sets up subclass filters
            for middle tables in a class hierarchy with more than 2 levels.  For
            example, with this code:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Employee</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Employee</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">single_table_inheritance</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">kind</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Manager</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Employee</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Executive</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Manager</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> previously would not
            return Executives if you used Manager.all.  It now correctly recognizes
            subclasses so that it will return both Managers and Executives.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel::Model.qualified_primary_key_hash has been added, giving you a hash
            that can be used for filtering.  It is similar to primary_key_hash, but it
            qualifies the keys with the model’s table.  It’s useful if you have joined
            the table to another table that has columns with the same name, but you
            want to only look for a single model object in that dataset.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>For consistency, you can now use Dataset#order_append as an alias for
            order_more.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now correctly removes
            schema entries when altering tables. Previously, some adapters that had to
            query the existing schema when altering tables resulted in the previous
            schema being cached.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model/Errors.html#method-i-on">Sequel::Model::Errors#on</a>
            now always returns nil if there are no errors on the attribute. 
            Previously, it would return an empty array in certain cases.  Additionally,
            <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model/Errors.html#method-i-empty-3F">Sequel::Model::Errors#empty?</a>
            now returns true if there are no errors, where it certain cases it would
            return false even if there were no errors.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The schema_dumper extension now works with tables specified as
            Sequel::SQL::Identifiers.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now recognizes the
            timestamp(N) with(out) time zone column type.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The lazy_attributes plugin no longer requires the core extensions to work
            correctly.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>DatabaseDisconnectError support has been added to the ODBC adapter,
            allowing <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> to detect
            disconnects and remove the connection from the connection pool.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A leak of JDBC statement objects when using transactions was fixed in the
            jdbc adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The jdbc adapter now gives a nicer error message if you use a connection
            string that it doesn’t recognize and there is an error when connecting.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Temporary table creation was fixed on Microsoft SQL Server, but it is not
            recommended as it changes the name of the table.  If you use Microsoft SQL
            Server, you should prefix your temporary table names with # and use the
            regular create table method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A large number of guides were added to <a

            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now uses a
            Sequel::NotImplemented exception class for these exceptions, which is a
            subclass of <a href="../../../classes/Sequel/Error.html">Sequel::Error</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> no longer applies all
            association options to the dataset used to remove all many_to_many
            associated objects.  You should use the new :join_table_block option to get
            similar behavior if you were filtering the many_to_many association based
            on columns in the join table and you wanted remove_all to only remove the
            related columns.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now calls certain before
            and after hook actions in plugins in a different order than before.  This
            should not have an effect unless you were relying on them being called in
            the previous order. Now, when overriding before hooks in plugins, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> always does actions before
            calling super, and when overriding after hooks in plugins, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> always does actions after
            calling super.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The hook_class_methods plugin no longer skips later after hooks if a
            previous after hook returns false.  That behavior now only occurs for
            before hooks.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now only removes primary
            key values when updating objects if you are saving the entire object and
            you have not modified the values of the primary keys.  Previously, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> would remove primary key
            values when updating even if you specified the primary key column
            specifically or the primary key column was modified and you used
            save_changes/update.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now uses explicit methods
            instead of aliases for certain methods.  This should only affect you if for
            example you overrode Dataset#group to do one thing and wanted
            Dataset#group_by to do the default action.  Now, Dataset#group_by, and
            methods like it, are explicit methods that just call the methods they
            previously aliased.  This also means that if you were overriding
            Dataset#group and explicitly aliasing group_by to it, you no longer need
            the alias.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The single_table_inheritance plugin now uses IN instead of = for subclass
            filters.  This could lead to poor performance if the database has a very
            bad query planner.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private transaction_statement_object method was removed from the JDBC
            adapter, and <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will no
            longer check for the presence of the method in the transaction code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The <a href="../../../classes/Sequel/Migrator.html">Sequel::Migrator</a>
            object is now a class instead of a module, and has been pretty much
            rewritten.  If you were using any methods of it besides apply and run, they
            no longer work.</p>
