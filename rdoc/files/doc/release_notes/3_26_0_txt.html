            <h1 id="label-Performance+Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The internal implementation of eager_graph has been made 75% to 225% faster
            than before, with greater benefits to more complex graphs.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset creation has been made much faster (2.5x on 1.8 and 4.4x on 1.9),
            and dataset cloning has been made significantly faster (40% on 1.8 and 20%
            on 1.9).</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Strings passed to setter methods for integer columns are no longer
            considered to be in octal format if they include leading zeroes. The
            previous behavior was never intended, but was a side effect of using
            Kernel#Integer.  Strings with leading zeroes are now treated as decimal,
            and you can still use the 0x prefix to treat them as hexidecimal.  If
            anyone was relying on the old octal behavior, let me know and I’ll add an
            extension that restores the octal behavior.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The identity_map plugin now works with the standard eager loading of
            many_to_many and many_through_many associations.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#create_table! now only attempts to drop the table if it already
            exists.  Previously, it attempted to drop the table unconditionally
            ignoring any errors, which resulted in misleading error messages if
            dropping the table raised an error caused by permissions or referential
            integrity issues.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The default connection pool now correctly handles the case where a
            disconnect error is raised and an exception is raised while running the
            disconnection proc.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Disconnection errors are now detected when issuing transaction statements
            such as BEGIN/ROLLBACK/COMMIT.  Previously, these statements did not handle
            disconnect errors on most adapters.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>More disconnection errors are now detected.  Specifically, the ado adapter
            and do postgres subadapter now handle disconnect errors, and the postgres
            adapter handles more types of disconnect errors.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#table_exists? now always issues a query to select from the table,
            it no longer attempts to parse the schema to determine the information on
            PostgreSQL and Oracle.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Date, DateTime, and Time values are now literalized correctly on Microsoft
            Access.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Connecting with the mysql adapter with an options hash now works if the
            :port option is a string, which makes it easier to use when the connection
            information is stored in YAML.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The xml_serializer plugin now works around a bug in pure-Java nokogiri
            regarding the handling of nil values.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Nicer error messages are now used if there is an attempt to call an invalid
            or restricted setter method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The RDocs are now formatted with hanna-nouveau, which allows for section
            ordering, so the Database and Dataset RDoc pages are more friendly.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>If you call a Dataset method such as each on an eager_graphed dataset, you
            now get plain hashes that have column alias symbol keys and their values.
            Previously, you got a graphed response with table alias keys and model
            values.  It’s not wise to depend on the behavior, the only supported way of
            returning records when eager loading is to use all.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An error is now raised if you attempt to eager load via Dataset#eager a
            many_to_many association that includes an :eager_graph option.  Previously,
            incorrect SQL would have been generated and an error raised by the
            database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Datasets are no longer guaranteed to have @row_proc,
            @indentifier_input_method, and @identifier_output_method defined as
            instance variables.  You should be be using methods to access them anyway.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#table_exists? on PostgreSQL no longer accepts an options hash. 
            Previously, you could use a :schema option.  You must now provide the
            schema inside the table argument (e.g. :schema__table).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>If you want to use the rdoc tasks in Sequel’s Rakefile, and you are still
            using the hanna RDoc template with RDoc 2.3, you need to upgrade to using
            hanna-nouveau with RDoc 3.8+.</p>
