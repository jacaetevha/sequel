            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has much better
            support for the DB2 database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An ibmdb adapter has been added, and is the recommended adapter to to use
            if you want to connect to DB2 from MRI.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A jdbc db2 subadapter has been added, allowing good DB2 support on JRuby.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The db2 adapter has been cleaned up substantially, and now works well, but
            it is still recommended that you switch to ibmdb if you are using the db2
            adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The firebird adapter has been split into shared and specific parts, and
            quite a few fixes were made to it.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A jdbc firebird subadapter has been added, allowing connection to firebird
            databases from JRuby.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-New+PostgreSQL+9.1+Features">New PostgreSQL 9.1 Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Dataset#returning has been added for using the RETURNING clause on
            INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries.  RETURNING allows such queries to return
            results in much the same way as a SELECT query works. When
            Dataset#returning is used, Dataset insert, update, and delete now accept a
            block that is passed to Dataset fetch_rows  which is yielded plain ruby
            hashes for each row inserted, updated, or deleted.  If Dataset#returning is
            used and a block is not given to those methods, those methods will return
            an array of plain hashes for all rows inserted, updated, and deleted.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#with_sql now treats a symbol as a first argument as a method name
            to call to get the SQL.  The expected use case for this is with
            Dataset#returning and insert/update/delete:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].&#x000A; <span class="ruby-identifier">returning</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>).&#x000A; <span class="ruby-identifier">with_sql</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">update_sql</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span> <span class="ruby-operator">+</span> <span class="ruby-value">1</span>).&#x000A; <span class="ruby-identifier">map</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>)</pre>
            
            <p>Basically, it makes it more easily to statically set the
            insert/update/delete SQL, and then be able to use the full dataset API for
            returning results.  As mentioned above, using Dataset#returning with
            insert, update, and delete yields plain hashes, so if you want to have the
            row_proc applied (e.g. you are using models), you need to use this method
            instead, since you can then call each or all to make sure the row_proc is
            called on all returned rows.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#with (common table expressions) now affects INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
            queries.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#create_table? now uses CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS on PostgreSQL
            9.1.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+New+Features">Other New Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The :limit option is now respected when eager loading via either eager or
            eager_graph.  By default, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>
            will just do an array slice of the resulting ruby array, which gets the
            correct answer, but does not offer any performance improvements.  <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> also offers a new
            :eager_limit_strategy option for using more advanced query types that only
            load the related records from the database. The available values for the
            :eager_limit_strategy option are:</p>
            
            <pre>:window_function - This uses the row_number window function&#x000A;  partitioned by the related key fields.  It can only be used&#x000A;  on databases that support window functions (PostgreSQL 8.4+,&#x000A;  Microsoft SQL Server 2005+, DB2).&#x000A;:correlated_subquery - This uses a correlated subquery that is&#x000A;  limited.  It works on most databases except MySQL and DB2.</pre>
            
            <p>You can provide a value of true as the option to have <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> pick a strategy to use. <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will never use a correlated
            subquery for true, since in some cases it can perform worse than loading
            all related records and doing the array slice in ruby.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to enable an eager_limit_strategy globally, you can set
            Sequel::Model.default_eager_limit_strategy to a value, and all associations
            that use :limit will default to using that strategy.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>one_to_one associations that do not represent true one-to-one database
            relationships, but represent one-to-many relationships where you are only
            returning the first object based on a given order are also now handled
            correctly when eager loading. Previously, eager loading such associations
            resulted in the last matching object being associated instead of the first
            matching object being associated.</p>
            
            <p>You can also use an :eager_limit_strategy for one_to_one associations.  In
            addition to the :window_function and :correlated_subquery values, there is
            also a :distinct_on value that is available on PostgreSQL for using
            DISTINCT ON, which is the fastest strategy if you are using PostgreSQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#map, to_hash, select_map, select_order_map, and select_hash now
            accept arrays of symbols, and if given arrays of symbols, use arrays of
            results.  For example:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">map</span>([:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>])&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; [[1, 'foo'], [2, 'bar'], ...]</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">to_hash</span>([:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">foo_id</span>], [:<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">bar_id</span>])&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; {[1, 3]=&gt;['foo', 5], [2, 4]=&gt;['bar', 6], ...}</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>For SQL expression objects where <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> cannot deduce the type of
            the object, it now will consider the type of the argument when a &amp;, |,
            or + operator is used.  For example:</p>
            
            <pre>:x &amp; 1</pre>
            
            <p>Previously, this did “x AND 1”, now it does “x &amp; 1”.  Using a logical
            operator on an integer doesn’t make sense, but it’s possible people did so
            if the database uses 1/0 for true/false. Likewise:</p>
            
            <pre>:x + 'foo'</pre>
            
            <p>Previously, this did “x + ‘foo’” (addition), now it does “x || ‘foo’”
            (string concatenation).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The sql_string, sql_number, and sql_boolean methods are now available on
            SQL::ComplexExpressions, so you can do:</p>
            
            <pre>(:x + 1).sql_string + ' foos'&#x000A;# (x + 1) || ' foos'</pre>
            
            <p>Previously, there was not an easy way to generate such SQL expressions.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>:after_load association hooks are now applied when using eager_graph. 
            Previously, they were only applied when using eager, not when using
            eager_graph.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#copy_table has been added to the postgres adapter if pg is used as
            the underlying driver.  It allows you to get very fast exports of table
            data in text or CSV format.  It also accepts datasets, allowing fast
            exports of arbitrary queries in text or CSV format.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>SQL extract support (:timestamp.extract(:year)) is now emulated on the
            databases that don’t natively support it, such as SQLite, Microsoft SQL
            Server, and DB2.  At least the following values are supported for
            extraction: :year, :month, :day, :hour, :minute, and :second.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The bitwise XOR operator is now emulated on SQLite.  Previously, attempting
            to use it would cause the database to raise an error.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A Database#use_timestamp_timezones accessor has been added on SQLite.  This
            allows you to turn off the use of timezones in timestamps by setting the
            value to false.  This is necessary if you want you want to use the SQLite
            datetime functions, or the new ability to emulate extract.</p>
            
            <p>Note that this setting does not affect the current database content.  To
            convert old databases to the new format, you’ll have to resave all rows
            that have timestamps.</p>
            
            <p>At some point in the future, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> may default to not using
            timezones in timestamps by default on SQLite, so if you would like to rely
            on the current behavior, you should set this accessor to true now.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now works around bugs in
            MySQL when using a subselect with a LIMIT by using a nested subselect.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now works around issues
            in Microsoft SQL Server and DB2 when using a subselect with IN/NOT IN that
            uses the emulated offset support.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The jdbc adapter now returns java.sql.Clob objects as Sequel::SQL::Blobs.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now considers database
            clob types as the :blob schema type.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQLTime.html#method-c-create">Sequel::SQLTime.create</a>
            has been added for more easily creating instances:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel::SQLTime.create(hour, minute, second, usec)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#select_all now accepts SQL::AliasedExpression and SQL::JoinClause
            arguments and returns the appropriate SQL::ColumnAll value that selects all
            columns from the related table.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model.set_dataset now accepts <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/LiteralString.html">Sequel::LiteralString</a>
            objects that represent table names.  This usage is not encouraged except in
            rare cases such as using a set returning function in PostgreSQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_cte? now takes an optional argument specifying the type of
            query (:insert, :update, :delete, :select).  It defaults to :select.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_returning? has been added.  It requires an argument
            specifying the type of query (:insert, :update, or :delete).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_cte_in_subqueries? has been added for checking for support
            for this ability.  Apparently, only PostgreSQL currently supports this. 
            For other adapters that support CTEs but not in subqueries, if a subquery
            with a CTE is used in a JOIN, the CTE is moved from the subquery to the
            main query.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_select_all_and_column has been added for seeing if “SELECT
            *, foo …” style queries are supported.  This is false on DB2, which doesn’t
            allow such queries.  When it is false, using select_append on a dataset
            that doesn’t specifically select columns will now change the query to do
            “SELECT table.*, foo …” instead, working around the limitation on DB2.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_ordered_distinct_on? has been added.  Currently, this is
            only true on PostgreSQL.  MySQL can emulate DISTINCT ON using GROUP BY, but
            it doesn’t respect ORDER BY, so it some cases it cannot be used
            equivalently.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#supports_where_true? has been added for checking for support of
            WHERE TRUE (or WHERE 1 if 1 is true).  Not all databases support using such
            a construct, and on the databases that do not, you have to use WHERE (1 =
            1) or something similar.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 3.27.0 was negatively
            affected by a serious bug in ActiveSupport's Time.=== that has still not
            been fixed, which broke the literalization of Time objects.  In spite of
            the bad precedent it sets, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now avoids using Time.=== on
            a subclass of Time to work around this ActiveSupport bug.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#with_pk now uses a qualified primary key instead of an unqualified
            primary key, which means it can now be used correctly after joining to a
            separate table.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Association after_load hooks when lazy loading are now called after the
            association has been loaded, which allows them to change which records are
            cached.  This makes the lazy load case more similar to the eager load case.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The metaprogrammatically created methods that implement Sequel’s DSL
            support have been made significantly faster by using module_eval instead of
            define_method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The type translation in the postgres, mysql, and sqlite adapters has been
            made faster by using Method objects that result in more direct processing.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Typecasting values for time columns from Time values to <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SQLTime.html">Sequel::SQLTime</a> values now
            correctly handles fractional seconds on ruby 1.9.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Dataset#insert_returning_sql has been changed to a private method in the
            PostgreSQL and Firebird adapters, and it operates differently than it did
            previously.  The private insert_returning_pk_sql and
            insert_returning_select_sql methods have been removed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#with_pk no longer does some defensive checking for misuse of
            primary keys (e.g. providing a composite key when the model uses a single
            key).  Previously, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> would
            raise an Error immediately, now such behavior is undefined, with the most
            likely behavior being the database raising an Error.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The :alias_association_type_map and :alias_association_name_map settings
            have been removed from the :eager_graph dataset option, in favor of just
            storing the related association reflection.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The internals of the db2 adapter have changed substantially, if you were
            relying on some of the private methods defined in it, you will probably
            have to modify your code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The firebird adapter was substanially modified, specifically parts related
            to insert returning autogenerated primary key values, so if you were
            previously using the adapter you should probably take more care than usual
            when testing your upgrade.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Dataset::WITH_SUPPORTED constant has been removed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Dataset#supports_cte? method now accepts an optional argument. If you
            overrode this method, your overridden method now must accept an optional
            argument.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>If you were previously doing:</p>
            
            <pre>:x &amp; 1</pre>
