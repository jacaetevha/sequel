            <h1 id="label-New+Adapter+Support">New Adapter Support</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has much better
            support for Oracle, both in the ruby-oci8-based oracle adapter and in the
            jdbc/oracle adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has much better
            support for connecting to HSQLDB using the jdbc adapter.  This support does
            not work correctly with the jdbc-hsqldb gem, since the version it uses is
            too old.  You'll need to load the .jar file manually until the gem is
            updated.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now has much better
            support for connecting to Apache Derby databases using the jdbc adapter. 
            This works with the jdbc-derby gem, but it's recommend you grab an updated
            .jar file as the jdbc-derby gem doesn't currently support truncate or
            booleans.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The db2 adapter has had most of the remaining issues fixed, and can now run
            Sequel’s test suite cleanly.  It’s still recommended that users switch to
            the ibmdb adapter if they are connecting to DB2.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A mock adapter has been added which provides a mock Database object that
            allows you to easily set the returned rows, the number of rows modified by
            update/delete, and the autogenerating primary key integer for insert.  It
            also allows you to set specific columns in the dataset when retrieving
            rows.  The specs were full of partial implementations of mock adapters,
            this mock adapter is much more complete and offers full support for mocking
            transactions and database sharding.  Example:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">mock</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">fetch=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{:<span class="ruby-identifier">id=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">1</span>}, :<span class="ruby-identifier">numrows=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">2</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">autoid=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">3</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">all</span>            <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; [{:id =&gt; 1}]</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">insert</span>         <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 3</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">insert</span>         <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 4</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">delete</span>         <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 2</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">items</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">2</span>) <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 2</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">sqls</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; ['SELECT ...', 'INSERT ...', ...]</span></pre>
            
            <p>In addition to being useful in the specs, the mock adapter is also used if
            you use bin/sequel without a database argument, which makes it much easier
            to play around with <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> on
            the command line without being tied to a real database.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-New+Transaction+Features">New Transaction Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Database after_commit and after_rollback hooks have been added, allowing
            you to set procs that are called after the currently- in-effect transaction
            commits or rolls back.  If the Database is not currently in a transaction,
            the after_commit proc is called immediately and the after_rollback proc is
            ignored.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model after_commit, after_rollback, after_destroy_commit, and
            after_destroy_rollback hooks have been added that use the new Database
            after_commit/after_rollback hook to execute code after commit or rollback.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#transaction now supports a :rollback =&gt; :reraise option to
            reraise any <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Rollback.html">Sequel::Rollback</a>
            exceptions raised by the block.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#transaction now supports a :rollback =&gt; :always option to
            always rollback the transaction, which is mostly useful when using
            transaction-based testing.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html#method-c-transaction">Sequel.transaction</a>
            has been added, allowing you to run simultaneous transactions on multiple
            Database objects:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.transaction([DB1, DB2]){...}&#x000A;# similar to:&#x000A;DB1.transaction{DB2.transaction{...}}</pre>
            
            <p>You can combine this with the :rollback =&gt; :always option to easily use
            multiple databases in the same test suite and make sure that changes are
            rolled back on all of them.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#in_transaction? has been added so that users can detect whether
            the code is currently inside a transaction.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The generic JDBC transaction support, used by 6 of Sequel’s jdbc subapters,
            now supports savepoints if the underlying JDBC driver supports savepoints.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+New+Features">Other New Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>A dataset_associations plugin has been added, allowing datasets to call
            association methods, which return datasets of rows in the associated table
            that are associated to rows in the current dataset.</p>
            
            <pre># Dataset of tracks from albums with name &lt; 'M'&#x000A;# by artists with name &gt; 'M'&#x000A;Artist.filter(:name &gt; 'M').albums.filter(:name &lt; 'M').tracks&#x000A;&#x000A;# SELECT * FROM tracks&#x000A;# WHERE (tracks.album_id IN (&#x000A;#   SELECT albums.id FROM albums&#x000A;#   WHERE ((albums.artist_id IN (&#x000A;#     SELECT artists.id FROM artists&#x000A;#     WHERE (name &gt; 'M')))&#x000A;#    AND (name &lt; 'M'))))</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#extend_datasets has been added, allowing you to do the equivalent
            of extending all of the database’s future datasets with a module.  For
            performance, it creates an anonymous subclass of the current dataset class
            and includes a module in it, and uses the subclass to create future
            datasets.</p>
            
            <p>Using this feature allows you to override any dataset method and call
            super, similar to how <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> plugins work.
            The method takes either a module:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.extension :columns_introspection&#x000A;DB.extend_datasets(Sequel::ColumnsIntrospection)</pre>
            
            <p>or a block that it uses to create an anonymous module:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">extend_datasets</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-comment"># Always select from table.* instead of *</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">from</span>(*<span class="ruby-identifier">tables</span>)&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span> = <span class="ruby-keyword">super</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-keyword">if</span> <span class="ruby-operator">!</span><span class="ruby-ivar">@opts</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">select</span>] <span class="ruby-operator">||</span> <span class="ruby-ivar">@opts</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">select</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">empty?</span>&#x000A;      <span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">select_all</span>(*<span class="ruby-identifier">tables</span>)&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">ds</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#&lt;&lt; and Dataset#&lt;&lt; now return self, which allow them to
            be used in chaining:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;UPDATE foo SET bar_id = NULL&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;DROP TABLE bars&quot;</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">foo</span>] <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> {:<span class="ruby-identifier">bar_id=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-value">0</span>} <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">bars</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">select</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>A Database#timezone accessor has been added, allowing you to override
            Sequel.database_timezone on a per-Database basis, which allows you to use
            two separate Database objects in the same process that have different
            timezones.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now modify the type conversion procs on a per-Database basis when
            using the mysql, sqlite, and ibmdb adapters, by modifying the hash returned
            by Database#conversion_procs.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model.dataset_module now accepts a Module instance as an argument, and
            extends the model’s dataset with that module.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When using the postgres adapter with the pg driver, you can now use
            Database#listen to wait for notifications.  All adapters that connect to
            postgres now support Database#notify to send notifications:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># process 1</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">listen</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'foo'</span>) <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">ev</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">pid</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">payload</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">ev</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 'foo'</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">notify_pid</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; some Integer</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">payload</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 'bar'</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># process 2</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">notify</span>(<span class="ruby-string">'foo'</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">payload=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">'bar'</span>)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>many_to_one associations now have a :qualify option that can be set to
            false to not qualify the primary key when loading the association.  This
            shouldn’t be necessary to use in most cases, but in some cases qualifying a
            primary key breaks certain queries (e.g. using JOIN USING on the same
            column on Oracle).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#schema can now take a dataset as an argument if it just selects
            from a single table.  If a dataset is provided, the schema parsing will use
            that dataset’s identifier_input_method and identifier_output_method for the
            parsing, instead of the database’s default.  This makes it possible for
            Model classes to correctly get the table schema if they use a dataset whose
            identifier_(input|output)_method differs from the database default.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On databases that support common table expressions (CTEs) but do not
            support CTE usage in subselects, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now emulates support by
            moving CTEs from the subselect to the main select when using the Dataset
            from, from_self, with, with_recursive, union, intersect, and except
            methods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The bitwise compliment operator is now emulated on H2.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now set the convert_tinyint_to_bool setting on a per-Database basis
            in the mysql and mysql2 adapters.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now set the convert_invalid_date_time setting on a per-Database
            basis in the mysql adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database instances now have a dataset_class accessor that allows you to set
            which class is used when creating datasets.  This is mostly used to
            implement the extend_datasets support, but it could be useful for other
            purposes.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#unused_table_alias now accepts an optional 2nd argument, which
            should be an array of additional symbols that should be considered as
            already used.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#requires_placeholder_type_specifiers? has been added to check if
            the dataset requires you use type specifiers for bound variable
            placeholders.</p>
            
            <p>The <a href="../prepared_statements_rdoc.html">prepared_statements</a>
            plugin now checks this setting and works correctly on adapters that set it
            to true, such as oracle.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#recursive_cte_requires_column_aliases? has been added to check if
            you must provide a column list for a recursive CTE.</p>
            
            <p>The rcte_tree plugin now checks this setting an works correctly on
            databases that set it to true, such as Oracle and HSQLDB.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Performance+Improvements">Performance Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Numerous optimizations were made to loading model objects from the
            database, resulting in a 7-16% speedup.</p>
            
            <p>Model.call was added, and now .load is just an alias for .call. This allows
            you to make the model dataset’s row_proc the model itself, instead of
            needing a separate block, which improves performance.</p>
            
            <p>While Model.load used to call .new (and therefore initialize), Model.call
            uses .allocate/set_values/after_initialize for speed. This saves a method
            call or two, and skips setting the @new instance variable.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#map, to_hash, select_map, select_order_map, and select_hash are now
            faster if any of the provided arguments are an array of symbols.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Model.[] optimization is now applied in more cases.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now creates accessor
            methods for all columns in a model's table, even if the dataset doesn't
            select the columns.  This has been the specified behavior for a while, but
            the spec was broken. This allows you do to:</p>
            
            <pre>Model.dataset = DB[:table].select(:column1, :column2)&#x000A;Model.select_more(:column3).first.column3</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model.def_dataset_method now correctly handles method names that can’t be
            used directly (such as method names with spaces).  This isn’t so the method
            can be used with arbitrary user input, but it will allow safe creation of
            dataset methods that are derived from column names, which could contain
            spaces.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model.def_dataset_method no longer overrides private model methods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The optimization that Model.[] uses now works correctly if the model’s
            dataset uses a different identifier_input_method than the database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sharding is supported correctly by default for the transactions used by
            model objects.  Previously, you had to use the sharding plugin to make sure
            the same shard was used for transactions as for the insert/update/delete
            statements.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now fully supports using
            an aliased table for the :join_table option of a many_to_many association. 
            The only real use case for an aliased :join_table option is when the join
            table is the same as the associated model table.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A bug when eagerly loading a many_through_many association with composite
            keys where one of the join tables requires an alias has been fixed.</p>

            <p>Sequel’s transaction internals have had substantial improvments. You can
            now open up simultaneous transactions on two separate shards of the same
            Database object in the same thread.  The new design allows for future
            support of connection pools that aren’t based on threads.  <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> no longer abuses
            thread-local variables to store savepoint state.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#select_map and select_order_map now return an array of single
            element arrays if given an array with a single entry as an argument. 
            Previously, they returned an array of values, which wasn’t consistent.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s emulation of bitwise operators with more than 2 arguments now
            works on all adapters that use the emulation.  The emulation was broken in
            3.28.0 when more than 2 arguments were used on H2, DB2, Microsoft SQL
            Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#columns now correctly handles the emulated offset support used on
            DB2, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server when using the jdbc, odbc, ado, and
            dbi adapters.  Previously, Dataet#columns could contain the row number
            column, which wasn’t in the hashes yielded by Dataset#each.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> can now parse primary key
            information on Microsoft SQL Server.  Previously, the only adapter that
            supported this was the jdbc adapter, which uses the generic JDBC support. 
            The shared mssql adapter now supports parsing the information directly from
            the database system tables.  This means that if you are using Model objects
            with a Microsoft SQL Server database using the tinytds, odbc, or ado
            adapters, the model primary key information will be set automatically.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s prepared statement support no longer defines singleton methods on
            the prepared statement objects.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>StringMethods#like is now case sensitive on SQLite and Microsoft SQL
            Server, making it more similar to other databases.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now works around an
            SQLite column naming bug if you select columns qualified with the alias of
            a subselect without providing an alias for the column itself.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now handles more bound
            variable types when using bound variables outside of prepared statements on

            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now works around a bug in
            certain versions of the JDBC/SQLite driver when emulating alter table
            support for operations such as drop_column.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now emulates the
            add_constraint and drop_constraint alter table operations on SQLite, though
            the emulation has issues.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now correctly handles
            composite primary keys when emulating alter_table operations on SQLite.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now applies the correct
            PRAGMA statements by default when connecting to SQLite via the amalgalite
            and swift adapters.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now supports using
            savepoints inside prepared transactions on MySQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now closes JDBC ResultSet
            objects as soon as it is done using them, leading to potentially lower
            memory usage in the JDBC adapter, and fixes issues if you try to drop a
            table before GC has collected a related ResultSet.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> can now correctly insert
            all default values into a table on DB2.  Before, this didn't work correctly
            if the table had more than one column.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Another type of disconnection error is now recognized in the mysql2
            adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now uses better error
            messages if you attempt to execute a prepared statement without a name
            using the postgres, mysql, and mysql2 adapters.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Some small fixes have been made that allow <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> to run better when $SAFE=1. 
            However, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> is not
            officially supported using $SAFE &gt; 0, so there could be many issues
            remaining.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s core and model specs were cleaned up by using the mock adapter to
            eliminate a lot of redundant code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s integration tests were sped up considerably, halving the execution
            time on some adapters.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Because Model.load is now an alias for .call, plugins should no longer
            override load.  Instead, they should override .call.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Loading model objects from the database no longer calls Model#initialize. 
            Instead, it calls Model.allocate, Model#set_values, and
            Model#after_initialize.  So if you were overriding initialize and expecting
            the changes to affect model objects loaded from the database, you need to
            change your code.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, @new is no longer set to false for objects retieved from the
            database, since setting it to false hurts performance. Model#new? still
            returns true or false, so this only affects you if you are checking the
            instance variables directly.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#&lt;&lt; no longer returns the autogenerated primary key for the
            inserted row.  As mentioned above, it now returns self to allow for
            chaining.  If you were previously relying on the return value, switch from
            #&lt;&lt; to insert.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#map no longer calls the row_proc if given an argument, and
            Dataset#to_hash no longer calls the row_proc if given two arguments. This
            should only affect your code if you were using a row_proc that modified the
            content of the hash (e.g. Model#after_initialize). If you were relying on
            the old behavior, switch:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">dataset</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">map</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">foo</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># to</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">dataset</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">map</span>{<span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">r</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">r</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">foo</span>]}&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">dataset</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">to_hash</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">foo</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">bar</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># to</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">h</span> = {}&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">dataset</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">each</span>{<span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">r</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">h</span>[<span class="ruby-identifier">r</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">foo</span>]] = <span class="ruby-identifier">r</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">bar</span>]}&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">h</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model classes now need to have a dataset before you can define associations
            on them.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model classes now pass their dataset to Database#schema, instead of their
            table name.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The :eager_block association option (which defaults to the association’s
            block argument) is now called before the :eager_graph association option
            has been applied, instead of after.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The many_to_many association reflection :qualified_right_key entry is now a
            method named qualified_right_key.  Switch any code using <a
            href="http://:qualified_right_key">association_reflection</a> to use
            association_reflection.qualified_right_key.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>If you are using like on SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server and want it to be
            case insensitive, switch to using ilike:</p>
            
            <pre># Case sensitive&#x000A;DB[:foos].where(:name.like('bar%'))&#x000A;# Case insensitive&#x000A;DB[:foos].where(:name.ilike('bar%'))</pre>
            
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now sets the
            case_sensitive_like PRAGMA to true by default on SQLite.  To set it to
            false instead, pass the :case_sensitive_like=&gt;false option to the
            database when creating it.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s alter table emulation on SQLite now renames the current table then
            populates the replacement table, instead of populating the replacement
            table at a temporary name, dropping the current table, and then renaming
            the replacement table.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The strings ‘n’ and ‘no’ (case insensitive) when typecasted to boolean are
            now considered false values instead of true.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The transaction internals had extensive changes, if you have any code that
            depended on the transaction internals, it will probably require changes.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Using the Sequel::MySQL module settings for convert_tinyint_to_bool and
            convert_invalid_date_time now only affects future Database objects.  You
            should switch to using the per-Database methods if you are currently using
            the Sequel::MySQL module methods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The customized transaction support in the do (DataObjects) adapter was
            removed.  All three subadapters (postgres, mysql, sqlite) of the do adapter
            implement their own transaction support, so this should have no effect
            unless you were using the do adapter with a different database type.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The oracle support changed dramatically, so if you were relying on the
            internals of the oracle support, you should take extra care when upgrading.</p>
