            <h1 id="label-New+Features">New Features</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>An eager_each plugin has been added, which automatically makes eagerly
            loaded datasets do eager loading if you call each (or another Enumerable
            method) instead of all.  By default, if you call each on an eager dataset,
            it will not do eager loading, and if you call each on an eager_graph
            dataset, you will get plain hashes with columns from all joined tables
            instead of model objects.  With this plugin, each on both eager and
            eager_graph datasets will do eager loading.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The nested attributes plugin now supports composite primary keys in
            associated records.  Additionally, it now deals better with natural primary
            keys in associated records.  There is a new :unmatched_pk option that can
            be set to :create if you want to create new associated records when the
            input hash contains primary key information that doesn’t match one of the
            existing associated objects.</p>
            
            <p>The nested attributes plugin now also supports a :transform option. If
            given, this option is called with the parent object and the input hash
            given for each associated record passed into the nested atttributes setter.
            The callable should return the hash of attributes to use.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#from_json in the json_serializer plugin now takes an options hash and
            recognizes the :fields option.  If the :fields option is given, it should
            be an array of field names, and set_fields is called with the array instead
            of using set.  This allows you to easily filter which fields in the hash
            are set in the model instance.  The entire options hash is also passed to
            set_fields if :fields is present, so you can additionally use the :missing
            =&gt; :raise or :missing =&gt; :skip options that set_fields supports.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Dataset#to_json method in the json_serializer plugin now respects
            :root=&gt;:collection and :root=&gt;:instance options.  If
            :root=&gt;:collection is given, only the collection is wrapped in a hash,
            and if :root=&gt;:instance is given, only the instances are wrapped in a
            hash.  For backwards compatibility, both the instances and collection are
            wrapped in a hash:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">to_json</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">root=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-keyword">true</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># {&quot;models&quot;:[{&quot;model&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1}}]}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">to_json</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">root=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">collection</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># {&quot;models&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1}]}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">to_json</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">root=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">instance</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># [{&quot;model&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1}}]</span></pre>
            
            <p>Wrapping both the collection and instance in a root by default is probably
            an undesired behavior, so the default for :root=&gt;true may change in the
            next major version of <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>. 
            Users who want the current behavior should switch to using :root=&gt;:both.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The schema_dumper extension now respects an :index_names option when
            dumping.  This option can be set to false to never dump the index names. 
            It can also be set to :namespace, in which case if the database does not
            have a global index namespace, it will automatically prefix the name of the
            index with the name of the table.</p>
            
            <p>Database#global_index_namespace? was added to check if the database uses a
            global index namespace.  If false, index names are probably namespaced per
            table (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>:each is now a valid prepared statement type.  This prepared statement type
            requires a block when you call the statement, and iterates over the records
            of the statement a row at a time. Previously, there wasn’t a way to iterate
            over the records of a prepared statement a row at a time, since the :select
            and :all types collect all rows into an array before iterating over them.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A :connection_handling=&gt;:queue option is now respected for database
            objects, and changes the threaded connection pools to use a queue instead
            of a stack as the data structure for storing available connections.  A
            queue does not perform as well as a stack, but reduces the likelihood of
            stale connections.</p>
            
            <p>It is possible that <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will
            change in the future from using a stack by default to using a queue by
            default, so any users who specifically desire a stack to be used should
            specify the :connection_handling=&gt;:stack option.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel/Migrator.html">Sequel::Migrator</a> now
            supports is_current? class method to check if there are no outstanding
            migrations to apply.  It also supports a check_current class method, which
            raises an exception if there are outstanding migrations to apply.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A pg_json extension has been added, supporting PostgreSQL’s 9.2 json type,
            similarly to the pg_array and pg_hstore extensions. Note that with the
            current PostgreSQL json code, the root object can be a string or number,
            but ruby’s json library requires the root json value to be an object or
            array.  So you will probably get an exception if you attempt to retrieve a
            PostgreSQL json value that ruby’s JSON library won’t parse.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A pg_inet extension has been added, which automatically typecasts
            PostgreSQL inet and cidr types to ruby IPAddr objects on retrieval.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#transaction on PostgreSQL now recognizes :read_only and
            :deferrable options, and can use them to set the READ ONLY and DEFERRABLE
            transaction flags.  A :synchronous option is also recognized, which can be
            set to true, false, :local, or :remote_write, and sets the value of
            synchronous_commit just for that transaction.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When adding and dropping indexes on PostgreSQL, a :concurrently option can
            be used to create or drop the index CONCURRENTLY, which doesn’t require a
            full write table lock.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When dropping indexes on PostgreSQL, :if_exists and :cascade options are
            now recognized.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When using alter_table set_column_type on PostgreSQL, the :using option is
            respected, and can be used to force a specific conversion from the previous
            value to the new value with the USING syntax.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On MySQL, you can now set an :sql_mode option when connecting.  This can be
            a string or symbol or an array of them, and each should match one of
            MySQL’s sql_modes.  MySQL’s default SQL mode is fairly loose, and using one
            of the strict sql modes is recommended, but for backwards compatibility, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will not set a specific SQL
            mode by default.  However, that may change in the next major version of <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, so to be forwards
            compatible you should set :sql_mode=&gt;nil if you do not desire a strict
            SQL mode to be set automatically.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Partial indexes are now supported on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 (SQL Server
            refers to them as filtered indexes).  Attempting to use a partial index on
            an earlier version of SQL Server will result in the database raising an
            exception.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A jdbc/progress adapter has been added, supporting the Progress database
            via the jdbc adapter.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Dataset#get now works correctly if you pass it a nil or false argument. 
            Previously, it ignored the argument and used the block instead.  If you
            want to use the block argument, you should not pass in a regular argument.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#call now passes any blocks given to it to the underlying prepared
            statement object.  Before, a passed block was ignored.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel::Model.db is no longer set automatically when creating an anonymous
            class with an associated database object.  This fixes cases where a library
            would create namespaced models, and the database used by the library would
            be set as the default for the user’s application code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model *_to_one association setters are now no-ops if you pass a value that
            is the same as the cached value.  This fixes issues with reciprocal
            associations getting reordered, and is better for performance.</p>
            
            <p>For cases where the old behavior is desired, the
            set_associated_object_if_same? method can be overridden to return true for
            object.  If you are manually setting objects in the associations cache
            before calling the setter method, you may want to set that.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The dirty plugin no longer affects the return value of refresh and lock!. 
            Internal changes should now help ensure that plugins don’t affect the
            return values of these methods.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now supports JRuby 1.7's
            new exception handling, fixing exception handling when connecting in the
            jdbc adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When dumping unsigned integer types in the schema dumper, if the unsigned
            values could overflow a 32-bit signed integer type, the generic Bignum
            class is used as the type.  This should fix issues when copying a database
            containing an unsigned 32-bit integer column with values between 2^31 and
            2^32-1.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In the optimistic_locking plugin, attempting to refresh and save after a
            failed save now works correctly.  Before, the second save would never
            modify a row.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Time types on jdbc/postgres are now typecasted accurately on retrieval,
            before they could be off by up to a millisecond due to floating point
            issues.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Disconnect detection in the mysql2 adapter has been improved.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The jdbc/mysql, do/mysql, and swift/mysql adapters all now support the
            :timeout option to set the MySQL wait_timeout.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Savepoints in prepared transactions are now supported on MySQL 5.5.23+,
            since the bug that caused them to be unsupported starting in 5.5.13 has
            been fixed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Parsing foreign key metadata for tables with an explicit schema now works
            correctly on PostgreSQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>bin/sequel -C now namespaces indexes automatically when copying from a
            database without a global index namespace to a database with a global index
            namespace.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Indexes are now dropped in reverse order that they were added in the
            schema_dumper.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Model typecasting code works around bugs in objects where object.==(”)
            would raise an exception instead of returning false.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A better error message is used if an invalid JDBC URL is provided and the
            JDBC driver’s new.connect method returns NULL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A document describing Sequel’s object model has been added, describing the
            objects <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> uses to represent
            SQL concepts.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Most adapter specific options to Database methods are now mentioned in the
            main Database method RDoc.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The nested_attributes plugin internals changed significantly.  If you were
            overriding one of the nested_attributes* private methods and calling super
            to get the default behavior, you may have to update your code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#case_sensitive_like has been removed on SQLite.  This method never
            worked correctly, it always returned false even if the case_sensitive_like
            PRAGMA was set.  That’s because SQLite doesn’t offer a getter for this
            PRAGMA, only a setter.  Note that Database#case_sensitive_like= still
            exists and works correctly.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#single_value has been removed from the native SQLite adapter. 
            This method was designed for internal use, and hasn’t been used for some
            time.  Any current users of the method should switch to
            Dataset#single_value.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private Database#defined_columns_for method in the SQLite adapter no
            longer takes an options hash.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A couple jdbc/postgres adapter methods are now private.  Previously, the
            jdbc/postgres adapter overrode some private superclass methods but left the
            methods public.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When using the optimistic_locking plugin, refreshing inside a before_update
            method after calling super will now result in the lock checking being
            skipped.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private Model#_refresh no longer returns self, so external plugins
            should no longer rely on that behavior.</p>
            </li></ul>
