            <ul><li>
            <p>Database#transaction now recognizes a :retry_on option, which should
            contain an exception class or array of exception classes. If the
            transaction raises one of the given exceptions, <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will automatically retry the
            transaction block.  It’s a bad idea to use this option if the transaction
            block is not idempotent.</p>
            
            <p>By default, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> only retries
            the block 5 times by default, to protect against infinite looping.  You can
            change the number of retries with the :num_retries option.</p>
            
            <p>Users of the :disconnect=&gt;:retry option are encouraged to switch to
            :retry_on=&gt;<a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/DatabaseDisconnectError.html">Sequel::DatabaseDisconnectError</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#escape_like has been added for escaping LIKE metacharacters.  This
            is designed for the case where part of the LIKE pattern is based on user
            input that should not treat the metacharacters specially.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Serialization failures/deadlocks are now raised as <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/SerializationFailure.html">Sequel::SerializationFailure</a>
            exception instances.  This exception class is a good candidate for the
            transaction :retry_on option.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On PostgreSQL, you can now provide the :force_standard_strings and
            :client_min_messages Database options to override the defaults on a
            per-instance basis.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On PostgreSQL, Database#tables and views now recognizes a :qualify option,
            which if true will return qualified identifiers instead of plain symbols.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Transaction isolation levels are now supported on Oracle, DB2, and all jdbc
            subadapters using the JDBC transaction support.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset.def_mutation_method now accepts a :module option for the module in
            which to define the methods (defaulting to self).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An unlimited_update plugin has been added.  It’s sole purpose is to
            eliminate a MySQL warning in replicated environments, since by default <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> uses a LIMIT
            clause when updating on MySQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The named_timezones extension now adds a Sequel.tzinfo_disambiguator
            accessor to automatically handle TZInfo::AmbiguousTime exceptions.  This
            should be a callable object that accepts two arguments, a DateTime instance
            and an array of timezone periods, and returns the timezone period to use.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now handles JSON
            securely, specifying the :create_additions=&gt;false option when using
            JSON.parse.  If you really want to get the old vulnerable behavior back,
            override <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html#method-c-parse_json">Sequel.parse_json</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The json_serializer and xml_serializer plugins are now secure by default. 
            Before, the default behavior of these plugins allowed for round tripping,
            such that:</p>
            
            <pre>Album.from_xml(album.to_xml) == album</pre>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, that requires that the deserialization allow the setting of
            any column.  Since the plugins also handle associations, you could also set
            any column in any associated object, even cascading to associated objects
            of those objects.</p>
            
            <p>The new default behavior only allows deserialization to set the same
            columns that mass-assignment would set, and not to handle associated
            objects at all by default.  The following additional options are supported:</p>
            
            <pre>:fields :: The specific fields to set (this was already supported&#x000A;           by the json_serializer plugin).&#x000A;:associations :: The specific associations to handle.&#x000A;:all_columns :: The previous behavior of setting all columns.&#x000A;:all_associations :: The previous behavior of setting all&#x000A;                     associations.</pre>
            
            <p>Since JSON parsing no longer deserializes into arbitrary ruby instances,
            from_json and array_from_json class methods have been added to the
            json_serializer plugin, for deserializing into model instances.  These
            mirror the from_xml and array_from_xml class methods in the xml_serializer
            plugin.</p>
            
            <p>Note that the :all_columns and :all_associations methods were only added to
            make backwards compatibility easier.  It is likely they will be removed in
            <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 4, along with the
            json_create class method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now attempts to use
            database specific error codes or SQLState codes instead of regexp parsing
            to determine if a more specific DatabaseError subclass should be used. 
            This should make error handling faster and more robust.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now uses ESCAPE '' when
            using LIKE, for similar behavior across databases.  Previously, no ESCAPE
            clause was used, so behavior differed across databases, with most not using
            escaping, and PostgreSQL, MySQL, and H2 defaulting to backslash as the
            escape character.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The query extension has been reimplemented and now uses a proxy object
            instead of Object#extend.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The :pool_timeout Database option now supports fractional seconds.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#quote_identifier is now a public method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Metadata parsing (schema, indexes, foreign_key_list) on PostgreSQL now
            correctly handles the case where an unqualified table name is used and
            tables with that name exist in multiple schemas.  It now picks the first
            matching table in the schema_search_path, instead of failing or returning
            results from all tables.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> instances no
            longer attempt to typecast the money type on PostgreSQL, since the previous
            typecast didn't work correctly, and correct typecasting is
            locale-dependent.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> no longer picks up
            foreign keys for tables in other databases when using
            Database#foreign_key_list on MySQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A warning when using the mysql2 3.12 beta has been eliminated.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A warning has been eliminated when using the jdbc/oracle adapter on JRuby
            1.7.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s ilike emulation should now work by default on databases without
            specific syntax support.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#from_self! no longer creates a self referential dataset.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Coverage testing now uses simplecov instead of rcov on ruby 1.9+.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The switch to using JSON.parse :create_additions=&gt;false means that if
            your app expected JSON to deserialize into arbitrary ruby objects, it is
            probably broken.  You should update your application code to manually
            convert the deserialized hashes into the ruby objects you want.</p>
            
            <p>Note that it’s not just this new version of <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> that will cause that, older
            versions of <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> will break in
            the same way if you update your JSON library to a version that is not
            vulnerable by default.</p>
            
            <p>This potentially affects the pg_json extension and serialization plugin if
            you were expecting the JSON stored in the database to be deserialized into
            arbitrary ruby objects.</p>
            
            <p>See the json_serializer/xml_serializer changes mentioned in the Other
            Improvements section.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The reimplemented query extension is not completely backwards compatible. 
            For example, inside a query block, self refers to the proxy object instead
            of a dataset, and calling methods that return rows no longer raises an
            exception.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The metadata parsing methods on PostgreSQL no longer work with unqualified
            tables where the table is not in the schema search path.  This makes
            metadata parsing consistent with how datasets operate.  For tables outside
            the schema search path, you must qualify it before use now.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, using a nonexistent table name will raise an exception
            instead of returning empty results in some cases.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Dataset#def_mutation_method instance method has been removed. This
            method added mutation methods directly on the dataset instance, which is
            generally not desired.  Using the def_mutation_method class method with the
            :module option is now the recommended approach.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The switch to using ESCAPE for LIKE characters is backwards incompatible on
            databases that don’t use escaping by default,  when backslash is used in a
            LIKE pattern as a regular character. Now you have to double the backslash
            in the pattern.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#database_error_regexps private method now can return any
            enumerable yielding regexp/exception class pairs, it is no longer specified
            to return a hash.</p>
            </li></ul>
