            <p>New Plugins</p>
            <hr style="height: 9px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>A class_table_inheritance plugin has been added, supporting model
            inheritance in the database using a table-per-model-class approach. Each
            table stores only attributes unique to that model or subclass hierarchy.</p>
            
            <p>For example, with this hierarchy:</p>
            
            <pre>    Employee&#x000A;   /        \&#x000A;Staff     Manager&#x000A;             |&#x000A;          Executive</pre>
            
            <p>the following database schema may be used (table - columns):</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>employees - id, name, kind</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>staff - id, manager_id</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>managers - id, num_staff</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>executives - id, num_managers</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>The class_table_inheritance plugin assumes that the main table (e.g.
            employees) has a primary key field (usually autoincrementing), and all
            other tables have a foreign key of the same name that points to the same
            key in their superclass’s table. For example:</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>employees.id  - primary key, autoincrementing</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>staff.id - foreign key referencing employees(id)</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>managers.id - foreign key referencing employees(id)</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>executives.id - foreign key referencing managers(id)</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>When using the class_table_inheritance plugin, subclasses use joined
            datasets:</p>
            
            <pre>Employee.dataset.sql  # SELECT * FROM employees&#x000A;Manager.dataset.sql   # SELECT * FROM employees&#x000A;                      # INNER JOIN managers USING (id)&#x000A;Executive.dataset.sql # SELECT * FROM employees&#x000A;                      # INNER JOIN managers USING (id)&#x000A;                      # INNER JOIN executives USING (id)</pre>
            
            <p>This allows Executive.all to return instances with all attributes loaded. 
            The plugin overrides deleting, inserting, and updating in the model to work
            with multiple tables, by handling each table individually.</p>
            
            <p>This plugin allows and encourages the use of a :key option to mark a column
            holding the class name.  This allows methods on the superclass to return
            instances of specific subclasses.</p>
            
            <pre>a = Employee.all # [&lt;#Staff&gt;, &lt;#Manager&gt;, &lt;#Executive&gt;]</pre>
            
            <p>This plugin requires the lazy_attributes plugin and uses it to handle
            subclass specific attributes that would not be loaded when calling
            superclass methods (since those wouldn’t join to the subclass tables).  For
            example:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">values</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># {:id=&gt;1, name=&gt;'S', :kind=&gt;'Staff'}</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">manager_id</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># Loads the manager_id attribute from the</span>&#x000A;                   <span class="ruby-comment"># database</span></pre>
            
            <p>The class_table_inheritance plugin requires JOIN USING and therefore is not
            supported on H2 or Microsoft SQL Server, which do not support that SQL-92
            feature.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An associations_dependencies plugin was added for deleting, destroying, or
            nullifying associated objects when destroying a model object.  This just
            gives an easy way to add the necessary before and after destroy hooks.  The
            following association types support the following dependency actions:</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>:many_to_many - :nullify (removes all related entries in join table)</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>:many_to_one - :delete, :destroy</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>:one_to_many - :delete, :destroy, :nullify (sets foreign key to NULL for
            all associated objects)</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>This plugin works directly with the association datasets and does not use
            any cached association values.  The :delete action will delete all
            associated objects from the database in a single SQL call. The :destroy
            action will load each associated object from the database and call the
            destroy method on it.</p>
            
            <p>The plugin call takes a hash of association symbol keys and  dependency
            action symbol values.  Alternatively, you can specify additional
            dependencies later using add_association_dependencies:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Business</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">association_dependencies</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">address=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">delete</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># or:</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">association_dependencies</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">add_association_dependencies</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">albums=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">destroy</span>,&#x000A;  :<span class="ruby-identifier">reviews=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">delete</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">tags=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">nullify</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>A force_encoding plugin was added that forces the encoding of strings used
            in model instances.  When model instances are loaded from the database, all
            values in the hash that are strings are forced to the given encoding. 
            Whenever you update a model column attribute, the resulting value is forced
            to a given encoding if the value is a string.  There are two ways to
            specify the encoding. You can either do so in the plugin call itself, or
            via the forced_encoding class accessor:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Album</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">force_encoding</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'UTF-8'</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-comment"># or</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">force_encoding</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">self</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">forced_encoding</span> = <span class="ruby-string">'UTF-8'</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            
            <p>This plugin only works on ruby 1.9, since strings don’t have encodings in
            1.8.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A typecast_on_load plugin was added, for fixing bad database typecasting
            when loading model objects. Most of Sequel’s database adapters don’t have
            complete control over typecasting, and may return columns that aren’t
            typecast correctly (with correct being defined as how the model object
            would typecast the same column values).</p>
            
            <p>This plugin modifies Model.load to call the setter methods (which typecast
            by default) for all columns given.  You can either specify the columns to
            typecast on load in the plugin call itself, or afterwards using
            add_typecast_on_load_columns:</p>
            
            <pre>Album.plugin :typecast_on_load, :release_date, :record_date&#x000A;# or:&#x000A;Album.plugin :typecast_on_load&#x000A;Album.add_typecast_on_load_columns :release_date, :record_date</pre>
            
            <p>If the database returns release_date and record_date columns as strings
            instead of dates, this will ensure that if you access those columns through
            the model object, you’ll get Date objects instead of strings.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A touch plugin was added, which adds Model#touch for updating an instance’s
            timestamp, as well as touching associations when an instance is updated or
            destroyed.</p>
            
            <p>The Model#touch instance method saves the object with a modified timestamp.
            By default, it uses the :updated_at column, but you can set which column to
            use. It also supports touching of associations, so that when the current
            model object is updated or destroyed, the associated rows in the database
            can have their modified timestamp updated to the current timestamp. 
            Example:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Album</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">touch</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">column=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">modified_on</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">associations=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">artist</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>A subclasses plugin was added, for recording all of a models subclasses and
            descendent classes.  Direct subclasses are available via the subclasses
            method, and all descendent classes are available via the descendents
            method:</p>
            
            <pre>c = Class.new(Sequel::Model)&#x000A;c.plugin :subclasses&#x000A;sc1 = Class.new(c)&#x000A;sc2 = Class.new(c)&#x000A;ssc1 = Class.new(sc1)&#x000A;c.subclasses    # [sc1, sc2]&#x000A;sc1.subclasses  # [ssc1]&#x000A;sc2.subclasses  # []&#x000A;ssc1.subclasses # []&#x000A;c.descendents   # [sc1, ssc1, sc2]</pre>
            
            <p>The main use case for this is if you want to modify all models after the
            model subclasses have been created.  Since mutable options are copied when
            subclassing, modifying parent classes does not affect current subclasses,
            only future ones.  The subclasses plugin allows you get all subclasses so
            that you can easily modify them.  The plugin only records subclasses
            created after the plugin call, though.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An active_model plugin was added, giving <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> an ActiveModel
            complaint API, in so much as it passes the ActiveModel::Lint tests.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>New Extensions</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>A named_timezones extension was added, allowing you to use named timezones
            such as “America/Los_Angeles” (the default <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> timezone support only
            supports UTC or local time). This extension requires TZInfo.  It also sets
            the <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html#attribute-c-datetime_class">Sequel.datetime_class</a>
            to  DateTime, so database timestamps will be returned as DateTime instances
            instead of Time instances.  This is because ruby’s Time class doesn’t
            support timezones other than UTC and local time.</p>
            
            <p>This plugin allows you to pass either strings or TZInfo::Timezone instance
            to Sequel.database_timezone=, application_timezone=, and
            typecast_timezone=.  If a string is passed, it is converted to a
            TZInfo::Timezone using TZInfo::Timezone.get.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s say you have the database server in New York and the application
            server in Los Angeles.  For historical reasons, data is stored in local New
            York time, but the application server only services clients in Los Angeles,
            so you want to use New York time in the database and Los Angeles time in
            the application.  This is easily done via:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.database_timezone = 'America/New_York'&#x000A;Sequel.application_timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'</pre>
            
            <p>Then, before timestamps are stored in the database, they are converted to
            New York time.  When timestamps are retrieved from the database, they are
            converted to Los Angeles time.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A thread_local_timezones extension was added.  This allows you to set a
            per-thread timezone that will override the default global timezone while
            the thread is executing.  The main use case is for web applications that
            execute each request in its own thread, and want to set the timezones based
            on the request.  The most common example is having the database always
            store time in UTC, but have the application deal with the timezone of the
            current user.  That can be done with:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.database_timezone = :utc&#x000A;# In each thread:&#x000A;Sequel.thread_application_timezone = current_user.timezone</pre>
            
            <p>This extension is designed to work with the named_timezones extension.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An sql_expr extension was added that adds .sql_expr methods to all objects,
            giving them easy access to Sequel’s DSL:</p>
            
            <pre>1.sql_expr &lt; :a     # 1 &lt; a&#x000A;false.sql_expr &amp; :a # FALSE AND a&#x000A;true.sql_expr | :a  # TRUE OR a&#x000A;~nil.sql_expr       # NOT NULL&#x000A;&quot;a&quot;.sql_expr + &quot;b&quot;  # 'a' || 'b'</pre>
            
            <p>Proc#sql_expr uses a virtual row:</p>
            
            <pre>proc{[[a, b], [a, c]]}.sql_expr | :x&#x000A;# (((a = b) AND (a = c)) OR x)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>A looser_typecasting extension was added, for using to_f and to_i instead
            of the more strict Kernel.Float and Kernel.Integer when typecasting floats
            and integers. To use it, you should extend the database with the
            Sequel::LooserTypecasting module after loading the extension:</p>
            
            <pre>Sequel.extension :looser_typecasting&#x000A;DB.extend(Sequel::LooserTypecasting)</pre>
            
            <p>This makes the behavior more like ActiveRecord:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">a</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">num_albums=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">'a'</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">num_albums</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 0</span></pre>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Other New Features</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>Associations now support composite keys.  All of the :*key options options
            now accept arrays of symbols instead of plain symbols. Example:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">primary_key</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># [:name, :city]</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Album</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">many_to_one</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">artist</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">key=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">artist_name</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">artist_city</span>]&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">Artist</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">one_to_many</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">albums</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">key=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">artist_name</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">artist_city</span>]</pre>
            
            <p>All association types are supported, including the built-in many_to_many
            association and the many_through_many plugin.  Both methods of eager
            loading work with composite keys for all association types. Setter and
            add/remove/remove_all methods also now work with composite keys.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Associations now respect a :validate option, which can be set to false to
            not validate when implicitly saving associated objects.</p>
            
            <p>There isn’t a lot of implicit saving in Sequel’s association methods, but
            this gives the user the control over validation when the association
            methods implicitly save an object.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In addition to the regular association methods, the nested_attributes
            plugin was also updated to respect the :validate_association option. It was
            also modified to not validate associated objects twice, once when the
            parent object was validated and again when the associated object was saved.
            Additionally, if you pass :validate=&gt;false to the save method when
            saving the parent object, it will not longer attempt to validate associated
            objects when saving them.</p>

            <p>Graphing now works with previously joined datasets.  The main use case of
            this is when eagerly loading (via eager_graph) model associations for

            <p>When <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> wraps exception in
            its own classes (to provide database independence), it now keeps the

            <p>The MySQL adapter now supports a Dataset#split_multiple_result_sets method
            that yields arrays of rows (one per result set), instead of rows.  This
            allows you to submit multiple statements at the same time (or call a stored
            procedure that returns multiple result sets), and know which rows are
            related to which result sets.</p>
            
            <p>This violates a lot of Sequel’s internal assumptions and should be used
            with care.  Existing row_procs are modified to work correctly, but graphing
            will not work on these datasets.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The ADO adapter now accepts a :conn_string option and uses that as the full
            ADO connection string.  This can be used to connect to any datasource ADO
            supports, such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Microsoft SQL Server shared adapter now supports a
            Database#server_version method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Microsoft SQL Server shared adapter now supports updating and deleting
            from joined datasets.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Microsoft SQL Server shared adapter now supports a Dataset#output
            method that uses the OUTPUT clause.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#_save now calls either Model#_insert or Model#_update for
            inserting/updating the row in the database.  This allows for easier
            overriding when you want to allow creating and updating model objects
            backed by a joined dataset.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#graph now takes a :from_self_alias option specifying the alias to

            graphed dataset.  It defaults to the first source table in the receiver.</p>

            <p>Other Improvements</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>Typecasting model attributes is now done before checking existing values,
            instead of after.  Before, the code for the model attribute setters would
            compare the given value to the existing entry.  If it didn’t match, the
            value was typecasted and then assigned.  That led to the following
            situation:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">a</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Album</span>[<span class="ruby-value">1</span>]&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">num_tracks</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; 10</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; {'num_tracks'=&gt;'10'}</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">set</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">changed_columns</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; [:num_tracks]</span></pre>
            
            <p>The new behavior typecasts the value first, and only sets it and records
            the column as changed if it doesn’t match the typecasted value.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#modified? is now always true if the record is new.  modified?
            indicates the instance’s status relative to the database, and since a new
            object is not yet in the database, and saving the object would add it, the
            object is considered modified. A consequence of this is that
            Model#save_changes now always saves if the object is new.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to check if there were changes to columns since the object was
            first initialized, you should use !changed_columns.empty?, which was the
            historical way to handle the situation.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The DataObjects (do) adpater now supports DataObjects 0.10.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#select_more and Dataset#order_more no longer affect the receiver. 
            They are supposed to just return a modified copy of the receiver instead of
            modifying the receiver itself.  For a few versions they have been broken in
            that they modified the receiver in addition to returning a modified copy.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Performance was increased for execution of prepared statements with
            multiple bound variables on MySQL.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On MySQL, database errors raised when preparing statements or setting bound
            variable values are now caught and raised as Sequel::DatabaseErrors.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>On MySQL, more types of disconnection errors are detected.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When altering columns in MySQL, options such as :unsigned, :elements, and
            :size that are given in the call are now respected.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>MySQL enum defaults are now handled correctly in the schema dumper.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The schema dumper no longer attempts to use unparseable defaults as
            literals on MySQL, since MySQL does not provide defaults as valid literals.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The emulated offset support in the shared Microsoft SQL Server adapter now
            works better with model classes (or any datasets with row_procs).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Microsoft SQL Server now supports using the WITH clause in delete, update,
            and insert calls.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Parsed indexes when connecting to Microsoft SQL Server via JDBC no longer
            include primary key indexes.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#insert_select now returns nil if disable_insert_returning is used
            in the shared PostgreSQL adapter.  This makes it work as expected with
            model object creation.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Calling Model.set_primary_key with an array of symbols to set a composite
            primary key is now supported.  You can also provide multiple symbol
            arguments to do the same thing.  Before, specifying an array of symbols
            broke the Model.[] optimization.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Literalization of timezones in timestamps now works correctly on Oracle.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>__FILE__ and __LINE__ are now used everywhere that eval is called with a
            string, which makes for better backtraces.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The native MySQL adapter now correctly handles returning before yielding
            all result sets.  Previously, this caused a commands out of sync error.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Table names in common table expressions are now quoted.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Oracle adapter’s Dataset#except now accepts a hash, giving it the same
            API as the default Dataset#except.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>When connecting to Microsoft SQL Server via ADO, allow Dataset#insert to
            take multiple arguments.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Fractional timestamps are no longer used on ODBC.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Schema parsing now works on MSSQL when the database is set to not quote
            identifiers.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Timezone offsets are no longer used on Microsoft SQL Server, since they
            only work for the datetimeoffset type.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Only 3 fractional digits in timestamps are used in Microsoft SQL Server,
            since an error is raised if the use the datetime type with more than that.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The integration test suite now has guards for expected failures when run on
            known databases.  Expected failures are marked as pending.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Backwards Compatibility</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>Graphing to an previously joined (but not graphed) dataset now causes the
            receiver to be wrapped in a subselect, so if you graph a dataset to a
            previously joined dataset, and then filter the dataset referring to tables
            that were in the joined dataset (other than the first table), the SQL
            produced will probably no longer be valid.  You should either filter the
            dataset before graphing or use the name of the first source of the joined
            dataset (which is what the subselected is aliased to) if filtering
            afterward.</p>
            
            <p>In certain cases, this change can cause tables to be aliased differently,
            so if you were graphing previously joined datasets and then filtering using
            the automatically generated aliases, you might need to modify your code.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The DataObjects (do) adpater no longer supports DataObjects 0.9.x.</p>

            <p>The Dataset#virtual_row_block_call private instance method has been
            removed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Sequel’s timezone support was significantly refactored, so if you had any
            custom modifications to the timezone support, they might need to be
            refactored as well.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The SQL generation code was significantly refactored, so if you had any
