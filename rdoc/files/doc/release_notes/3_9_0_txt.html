            <p>New Features</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>The ConnectionPool classes were refactored from 2 separate classes to a 5
            class hierarchy, with one main class and 4  subclasses, one for each
            combination of sharding and threading.</p>
            
            <p>The primary reason for this refactoring is to make it so that the user
            doesn’t have to pay a performance penalty for sharding if they aren’t using
            it.  A connection pool that supports sharding is automatically used if the
            :servers option is used when setting up the database connection.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, the default connection pool no longer contains the code to
            schedule future disconnections of currently allocated connections.  The
            sharded connection pool must be used if that feature is desired.</p>
            
            <p>The unsharded connection pools are about 25-30% faster than the sharded
            versions.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>An optimistic_locking plugin was added to <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a>.  This plugin
            implements a simple database-independent locking mechanism to ensure that
            concurrent updates do not override changes:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Person</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">plugin</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">optimistic_locking</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">p1</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Person</span>[<span class="ruby-value">1</span>]&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">p2</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Person</span>[<span class="ruby-value">1</span>]&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># works</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">p1</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">name=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">'Jim'</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># raises Sequel::Plugins::OptimisticLocking::Error</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">p2</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">name=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">'Bob'</span>)</pre>
            
            <p>In order for this plugin to work, you need to make sure that the database
            table has a lock_version column (or other column you name via the
            lock_column class level accessor) that defaults to 0.</p>
            
            <p>The optimistic_locking plugin does not work with the
            class_table_inheritance plugin.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#unused_table_alias was added, which takes a symbol and returns
            either that symbol or a new symbol which can be used as a table alias when
            joining a table to the dataset.  The symbol returned is guaranteed to not
            already be used by the dataset:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">test</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">unused_table_alias</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">blah</span>) <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; :blah</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">test</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">unused_table_alias</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">test</span>) <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; :test_0</span></pre>
            
            <p>The use case is when you need to join a table to a dataset, where the table
            may already be used inside the dataset, and you want to generate a unique
            alias:</p>
            
            <pre>ds.join(:table.as(ds.unused_table_alias(:table)), ...)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>The <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/ValidationFailed.html">Sequel::ValidationFailed</a>
            exception now has an errors accessor which returns the <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model/Errors.html">Sequel::Model::Errors</a>
            instance with the validation errors.  This can be helpful in situations
            where a generalized rescue is done where the model object reference is not
            available.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>bin/sequel now works without an argument, which is useful for testing SQL
            generation (and not much else).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Support SELECT … INTO in the MSSQL adapter, using Dataset#into, which takes
            a table argument.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now provide your own connection pool class via the :pool_class
            option when instantiating the database.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Other Improvements</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>IN/NOT IN constructs with an empty array are now handled properly.</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">table</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">filter</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[]) <span class="ruby-comment"># IN</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">table</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">exclude</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[]) <span class="ruby-comment"># NOT IN</span></pre>
            
            <p>Before, the IN construct would mostly work, other than some minor
            differences in NULL semantics.  However, the NOT IN construct would not
            work.  <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now handles the
            NOT IN case using an expression that evaluates to true.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>If using an IN/NOT IN construct with multiple columns and a dataset
            argument, where multiple column IN/NOT IN support is emulated, a separate
            query is done to get the records, which is then handled like an array of
            values.  This means that the following type of query now works on all
            tested databases:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">table1</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">filter</span>([:<span class="ruby-identifier">id1</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">id2</span>]=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">table2</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">select</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">id1</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">id2</span>))</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Schemas and aliases are now handled correctly when eager graphing.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Implicitly qualified symbols are now handled correctly in update
            statements, useful if you are updating a joined dataset and need to
            reference a column that appears in multiple tables.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The active_model plugin has been brought up to date with activemodel 3.0
            beta (though it doesn’t work on edge). Additionally, the active_model
            plugin now requires active_model in order to use ActiveModel::Naming.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In the schema_dumper extension, always include the varchar limit, even if
            it is 255 columns (the default).  This makes it so that PostgreSQL will use
            a varchar(255) column instead of a text column when restoring a schema dump
            of a varchar(255) column from another database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now load adapters from outside the <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> lib directory, now they just
            need to be in a sequel/adapters directory somewhere in the LOAD_PATH.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now load extensions from outside the <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> lib directory using <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html#method-c-extension">Sequel.extension</a>.
            External extensions need to be in a sequel/extensions directory somewhere
            in the LOAD_PATH.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Using bound variables for limit and offset in prepared statements now works
            correctly.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Performance of prepared statements was improved in the native SQLite
            adapter.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The schema_dumper extension now passes the options hash from
            dump_*_migration to Database#tables.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In the single_table_inheritance plugin, qualify the sti_key column with the
            table name, so that subclass datasets can safely be joined to other tables
            having the same column name.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In the single_table_inheritance plugin, handle case where the sti_key value
            is nil or ” specially, so that those cases always return an instance of the
            main model class.  This fixes issues if constantize(nil) returns Object
            instead of raising an exception.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>No longer use Date#to_s for literalization, always use ISO8601 format for
            dates.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A couple lambdas which were instance_evaled were changed to procs for ruby
            1.9.2 compatibility.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>MSSQL emulated offset support was simplified to only use one subquery, and
            made to work correctly on ruby 1.9.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Emulate multiple column IN/NOT IN on H2, since it doesn’t handle all cases
            correctly.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>ODBC timestamps are now handled correctly if the database_timezone is nil.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>ArgumentErrors raised when running queries in the ODBC adapter are now
            raised as DatabaseErrors.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Attempting to use DISTINCT ON on SQLite now raises an error before sending
            the query to the database.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The options hash passed to the database connection method is no longer
            modified.  However, there may be additional options present in
            Database#opts that weren’t specified by the options hash passed to the
            database connection method.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Make Dataset#add_graph_aliases handle the case where the dataset has not
            yet been graphed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>You can now provide an SQL::Identifier as a 4th argument to
            Dataset#join_table, and unsupported arguments are caught and an exception
            is raised.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The gem specification has been moved out of the Rakefile, so that the gem
            can now be built without rake, and works well with gem build and bundler.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Rakefile no longer assumes the current directory is in the $LOAD_PATH,
            so it should work correctly on ruby 1.9.2.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>All internal uses of require are now thread safe.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Empty query parameter keys in connection strings are now ignored instead of
            raising an exception.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The specs were changed so that you can run them in parallel. Previously
            there was a race condition in the migration extension specs.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <p>Backwards Compatibility</p>
            <hr style="height: 10px">
            <ul><li>
            <p>If you plan on using sharding at any point, you now must pass a :servers
            option when connecting to the database, even if it is an empty hash.  You
            can no longer just call Database#add_servers later.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The connection_proc and disconnection_proc accessors were removed from the
            connection pools, so you can no longer modify the procs after the
            connection pool has been instantiated.  You must now provide the
            connection_proc as the block argument when instantiating the pool, and the
            disconnection_proc via the :disconnection_proc option.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>In the hash passed to Dataset#update, symbol keys with a double embedded
            underscore are now considerated as implicit qualifiers, instead of being
            used verbatim.  If you have a column that includes a double underscore, you
            now need to wrap it in an SQL::Identifier or use a <a
            href="../../../classes/String.html">String</a> instead.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The connection pools no longer convert non-StandardError based exceptions
            to RuntimeErrors.  Previously, all of the common adapters turned this
            feature off, so there is no change for most users.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p><a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel/ConnectionPool.html">Sequel::ConnectionPool</a>
            is now considered an abstract class and should not be instantiated
            directly.  Use ConnectionPool.get_pool to return an instance of the
            appropriate subclass.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Sequel::SingleThreadedPool constant is no longer defined.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private Dataset#eager_unique_table_alias method was removed, use the
            new public Dataset#unused_table_alias method instead, which has a slightly
            different API.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private Dataset#eager_graph_qualify_order method was removed, used
            Dataset#qualified_expression instead.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The private <a href="../../../classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a>
            class methods plugin_gem_location and plugin_gem_location_old have been
            removed.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Gems built with the rake tasks now show up in the root directory instead of
            the pkg subdirectory, and no tarball package is created.</p>
