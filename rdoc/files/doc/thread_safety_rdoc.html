            <p>Most <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> usage (and all common
            <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> usage) is thread safe by
            default.  Specifically, multiple threads can operate on Database instances,
            Dataset instances, and Model classes concurrently without problems.  In
            general, Database instance and Model classes are not modified after
            application startup, and modifying Dataset instances returns modified
            copies of the dataset instead of mutating it.</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Connection+Pool">Connection Pool</h2>
            
            <p>In order to allow multiple threads to operate on the same database at the
            same time, <a href="../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> uses a connection
            pool.  The connection pool is designed so that a thread uses a connection
            for the minimum amount of time, returning the connection to the pool as
            soon as it is done using the connection.  If a thread requests a connection
            and the pool does not have an available connection, a new connection will
            be created.  If the maximum number of connections in the pool has already
            been reached, the thread will block (actually busy-wait) until a connection
            is available or the connection pool timeout has elapsed (in which case a
            PoolTimeout error will be raised).</p>
            
            <h2 id="label-Exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
            
            <p>This is a small list of things that are specifically non thread-safe.  This
            is not an exhaustive list, there may be cases not mentioned here.</p>
            
            <p>1) Model instances: Model instances are not thread-safe unless they are
            frozen first.  Multiple threads should not operate on an unfrozen model
            instance concurrently.</p>
            
            <p>2) Model class modifications: Model class modifications, such as adding
            associations and loading plugins, are not designed to be thread safe.  You
            should not modify a class in one thread if any other thread can
            concurrently access it.  Model subclassing is designed to be thread-safe,
            so you create a model subclass in a thread and modify it safely.</p>
            
            <p>3) Dataset mutation methods: Dataset mutation methods are not thread safe,
            you should not call them on datasets that could be accessed by other
            threads.  It is safe to clone the dataset first inside a thread and call
            mutation methods on the cloned dataset.</p>
